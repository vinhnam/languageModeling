Too early for a vacuum cleaner , but probably Sam wanted the whole house in order before he came downstairs . 
He was kneeling to tie his shoelaces . 
His fingers felt absurdly thick and clumsy . 
He rose slowly and looked into the mirror on the inside of the closet door . 
He barely knew himself . 
This was some freak , two strands of adhesive tape across his nose , like ugly roots from the mass of gauze , suddenly moist over his cheekbones . 
The surface , however , was perfectly white . 
He was drinking another glass of water . 
It was after seven o'clock . 
He was supposed to be in court this afternoon , at City Hall . 
Who would take over ? ? 
He'd have to think , but the main thing , the imperative necessity , was to leave before Sam Bentley was up and about , and before Millie detained him with sympathy . 
He entered the hallway . 
He was actually walking down the stairs . 
A plane up in the sky , above the clouds , and this freakish wreck of a man desperately trying to get away . 
`` Father , is that you '' ? ? 
The voice issued from the cavern of the hall below . 
George did not reply . 
`` Is that you , Father ? ? 
Who's there '' ? ? 
For a moment he felt like a thief discovered . 
Then Julia appeared under the arch leading to the dining room . 
She stood gazing at him . 
`` Uncle George '' ! ! 
He was trying to smile at her . 
`` Gosh ! ! 
You shouldn't be up , should you '' ? ? 
`` I -- I was just leaving here , Julie . 
I'm all set . 
Just about to call a taxi '' . 
She was wearing some sort of gray blazer . 
She seemed overly tall , her brow knitted in concern . 
`` Well , at least you won't have to do that '' , she was saying . 
`` I'm about to leave myself . 
I'll drop you off '' . 
`` You're leaving '' ? ? 
`` I'm going back to school '' , she answered . 
`` Pietro's driving me . 
I'm just finishing breakfast . 
But have you told Mother you were going '' ? ? 
She asked him . 
`` No . 
I just don't want anyone disturbed , Julie . 
That's my wish . 
It's quite a big one '' , he added . 
Her face seemed to float in an implausibly bright shaft of sunlight . 
`` Well , won't you come in then , have a cup of coffee -- or something ? ? 
Or maybe a drink '' ? ? 
She asked , in a way that seemed oddly sophisticated , considerate , and yet perhaps partly scornful . 
He tried to see her face more clearly . 
`` No -- nothing at all '' , he said after a moment's hesitation . 
`` I'll just wait for you here '' . 
He leaned his head against the wood paneling behind him , but the vivid red images of pain inserted themselves against his eyelids . 
He raised them . 
Julia moved past . 
`` I have to say good-bye upstairs . 
I won't be long '' . 
`` As a great favor , Julie '' , he said , `` please don't mention you've seen me '' . 
`` Not to anyone '' ? ? 
`` No -- please . 
`` I'll call your mother as soon as I get home . 
It'll be so much easier '' . 
`` All right '' She was staring at him . 
`` I'm fine , Julie . 
Please , you just go ahead '' . 
She had disappeared . 
He could feel a pulse pounding against the bandages . 
He imagined Sam's voice : `` George , what the hell goes on '' ? ? 
I wouldn't have the strength to answer , he thought . 
Maybe I couldn't have called a taxi . 
He could hear the footsteps overhead . 
He saw the suitcase , which Julia was holding . 
He stood up . 
`` I'll take that , Julie -- for you '' . 
`` Oh no '' , she said . 
`` I can manage '' . 
She went ahead of him . 
Outside the Lincoln was parked . 
He could hardly believe he was getting in . 
Pietro was gazing at him in an insolent , disdainful fashion ; ; 
but that didn't matter . 
We'll drop Mr. Rawlings off in Ardmore '' , Julia said , and for the merest second George was reminded of her father's tone with servants . 
To the manner born -- odd to have such a thought at a time like this ; ; 
yet her inflection seemed forced or rehearsed . 
He could not stop to analyze . 
He had never felt particularly close to her . 
Carrie seemed more affectionate , but obviously Julia had respected his request . 
He took her hand . 
`` I wish I didn't have to go back to school '' , she said , and then , `` I wish you lived in New York . 
That's in the opposite direction '' . 
`` I wish I did '' , he responded . 
`` I wish I wasn't wearing this ridiculous costume , and that we could go to a theater together , or a nice restaurant , forget we knew '' He stopped speaking . 
`` Forget we ever knew what '' ? ? 
`` Oh , just sort of everything in general '' . 
She said nothing until Pietro had slackened their pace . 
`` I know you feel badly , but that sounds like such a queer thing for you to say '' . 
`` Does it '' ? ? 
He asked . 
`` Yes , perhaps . 
I'm supposed to joke about things , aren't I ? ? 
But sometimes life can be rather a disappointing business '' . 
His voice seemed thick and purposeless . 
He relinquished her hand . 
He could see the stone building where he lived . 
Just a few more steps . 
Abruptly he reached into his pocket . 
Yes , there was the key . 
`` Are you positive you'll be all right by yourself '' ? ? 
She asked him . 
For a moment he smiled . 
`` Yes , Julie dear . 
You've done me the greatest possible service . 
By myself I'll be fine '' . 
`` Take care of yourself then '' . 
`` I will . 
You , also . 
Don't work too hard '' . 
It was an automatic phrase ; ; 
as he crossed through the courtyard he regretted it . 
He should have discovered a more tender farewell . 
Someone shouted at him , `` Well ! ! 
Will you look at George Rawlings ! ! 
What happened to you '' ? ? 
`` I bumped into a door handle '' , George said . 
Someone laughed . 
George walked steadily ahead into his entry . 
His bandages seemed on fire . 
He had shut his door with the brass number screwed to it . 
In the kitchenette the raw whiskey made him gasp . 
Just one or two swallows , he told himself , enough to lessen some of the pain . 
He was telephoning . 
`` No , Millie , I'm home . 
No , really , right as rain . 
Tell Sam not to worry about the car . 
I'll get it hauled away . 
No , please -- no visit today -- I'll be asleep . 
For God's sake , don't worry . 
That upsets me more than anything . 
Yes , sure , I'll see the doctor -- this evening , if you insist . 
'' 
There was one more call to make . 
`` Joan , did I wake you '' ? ? 
He asked . 
`` Yes , I thought you'd probably be up . 
Look , sweetheart , some fool was . 
Happened to be driving somewhat intoxicated last night . 
Unfortunately it turned out to be me , but I wouldn't quite put it that way to the boss . 
Oh hell no , I'm not in a hospital . 
I won't be in town for a couple of days , though , and there's that case I was supposed to handle this afternoon . 
Too bad a jury isn't involved . 
I might struggle in for a jury . 
I'd win hands down . 
But I thought maybe Tony Elliott could pinch-hit for me . 
He'll understand -- you might give him sort of a tactful nudge . 
He's got all the facts . 
I wouldn't want to ask for a postponement -- it's really just a routine thing . 
What ? ? 
No , darling I'd rather you didn't come out '' . 
A smile pulled at the lower strip of adhesive tape . 
`` Don't even send flowers . 
I'll see you Wednesday . 
I'll bribe you with a nice '' -- He was about to say `` double martini '' but thought better of it . 
`` I'll take you out to dinner . 
Okay ? ? 
'' 
He had put down the receiver . 
A strange relationship between Joan Fulbright and himself . 
Who knew about it ? ? 
She lived alone in the older part of the city , in one of those renovated houses whose brick facade some early settler had constructed . 
She had two tiny rooms on the second floor . 
She was a clever girl , a most efficient secretary . 
She let him come and go as he pleased , or as it pleased her . 
In the office you might have thought them only casual friends ; ; 
yet if he said : Make an excuse yourself , come out here today , she would have been on the next train -- and , similarly , if she had been in need , he would have gone to her . 
`` They make us conformists look good '' . 
`` That's a peculiar way to think '' . 
It wasn't just the obnoxious birds that had ruffled her own feathers , of course ; ; 
she knew that . 
It was Jim's `` little '' sister Myra , the unreliable , irresponsible , forever flyaway , Myra . 
She's a year older than I am , Lucy told herself . 
`` Come , come '' , Jim said , jollying Lucy a little . 
`` I love you . 
Susan ready '' ? ? 
Lucy listened . 
Obviously , Susan was not . 
Upstairs , busy feet , showering like raindrops , pattered around her room . 
Susan would be visiting her grandmother for only a few days , but even at seven she was a prudent soul ; ; 
she always packed for a lifetime , just in case . 
`` Not yet . 
Every doll in the house must be going with her '' . 
`` She'd better step on it . 
It's a long way to Websterville '' . 
Jim's fine young face was an expressive one , too ; ; 
as he looked at her , it registered anxiety . 
`` You know '' , he said . 
`` Myra wanted me to thank you for taking Cathy . 
It'll be only a couple of weeks before she finds a home for them in Paris -- but even so , she wants you to know that she's awfully grateful '' . 
Lucy did not believe him ; ; 
Myra appreciated nothing . 
Jim had put the thanks in his sister's mouth . 
`` Darling '' -- she said , and the single word mingled love and exasperation in an equal blend . 
`` She should have told me herself . 
And will it be only a couple of weeks ? ? 
Remember what happened the last time '' ? ? 
Leaving Cathy with them , Myra had gone out to the Coast for a supposedly brief visit ; ; 
but she had stayed all winter , and Cathy had stayed all winter too -- with them . 
Lucy suspected that Myra would never have come home if Gregg , Myra's husband , hadn't gone out to fetch her . 
`` That was an awfully long two weeks '' . 
For an otherwise silent moment , Jim's keys jingled nervously in his pocket . 
`` But she promised -- This will be different '' , he said at last . 
`` You've got to admit she was smart to scare up this fine government job over there -- she'll get a home for herself and Cathy in no time . 
You'll see , Myra's settling down '' . 
On the defensive , he added , `` I wish you'd think what it must be like for her to be without Greg , to be a new widow , a young widow '' . 
`` It depends on the widow '' . 
Lucy had an idea that Myra loved it . 
And not for one moment did she believe that Myra had settled down . 
It seemed to Lucy that all their married life , she and Jim had been doing nothing but rescue his sister from the constant crises that were her way of life . 
Remembering that succession of disasters , she now considered Cathy , an ominous child-cloud on her horizon . 
It was not that she disliked Cathy . 
The youngster drew her , troubled her depths ; ; 
whenever Lucy saw her , she tried , without noise or fuss , to give her the warmth she had never had from Myra . 
But Cathy was Myra's responsibility , not hers . 
`` I wouldn't even be surprised '' , she said unhappily , `` if Myra tried to leave her with us forever '' . 
Myra loved big cities ; ; 
thousands of miles away -- in Paris , of all places -- she might forget she had ever been a mother . 
Lucy knew her too well to find it impossible . 
`` That's a horrible thing to accuse her of '' ! ! 
Jim was so indignant it was obvious that no matter what he said , he too had seen the looming specter of a forever-Cathy . 
He went to the foot of the stairs and shouted up , fiercely , `` Susan ! ! 
Susan ! ! 
Get moving '' ! ! 
A startled piping sound returned . 
`` Don't yell at Susan '' , Lucy said . 
Was it only a few nights ago that they had been standing together in front of the house looking at the moon-washed river ? ? 
Their arms around each other , they had been talking of the present and the future ; ; 
their talk and their feeling had been as deep and warm , as steeped in light , as the air around them . 
Then , from within the still , sleeping house , the telephone had rung ; ; 
Myra , with her news , was on the other end of the line . 
Jim turned back from the stairway and looked at her . 
His dark brows , which had been lowered in anger , smoothed . 
`` Please '' , he said . 
`` There isn't a chance of Myra's letting anything like that happen . 
Let's stay friends '' . 
But they weren't just friends , Lucy thought ; ; 
they were husband and wife , and Myra had no right muddling and chilling their marriage . 
The only thing that had ever come between them was that worthless , selfish sister of his . 
Lucy was sick of it . 
`` Well , at last '' , she said , because Susan was clattering down the stairs . 
Susan looked like an overwhelmed baby nurse ; ; 
her arms were straining with a burden of dolls . 
`` I'm ready '' , she announced . 
`` Do you need that big bundle '' ? ? 
Jim said . 
His voice had sharp edges , as though he knew very well Lucy and he were not friends at the moment . 
`` All that junk '' ? ? 
Susan stared at him with hurt blue eyes that gushed an instant grief ; ; 
to her , each of her dolls was a real person with a living heart . 
`` Now , now '' , Lucy said , approaching Susan with a handkerchief , mopping skillfully . 
`` Your father didn't mean it , Susan '' . 
She gave Jim a quick , shape-up look of warning . 
`` She'll take every one of them '' . 
Jim groaned , but he lifted Susan's suitcase and said , in a gentler tone , `` Sure -- the entire thousand . 
And when you get back from Grandma's , Cathy will be here to play with you . 
Nice '' ? ? 
`` No '' , Susan said , grappling with her outsized armload of dolls with a Scrooge-like effect . 
And at this point , Lucy thought , there should be a lecture on little cousins' sharing dolls -- but she could sympathize with Susan ; ; 
there ought to be a limit to sharing , too . 
That was one more reason she didn't look forward to Cathy's visit , short or long ; ; 
the last one had been a Lilliputian war . 
She suspected that Cathy had been competing with Susan for attention that she had never had . 
`` Well '' , Jim said , out of the silence , `` let's get going , dolls and all '' . 
When the car , with Susan's hands waving wildly from the rear window , disappeared down the driveway , Lucy stood looking after its pale dust . 
The day was brilliant around her -- flower-scented , crisp with breeze -- yet her inner turmoil darkened it . 
She had let Jim go with a chilly good-by , a chillier kiss . 
She was sorry , and angry at herself , because never in their life together had she done that . 
She turned and began to walk toward the house . 
At the feeding station , the raffish group of cowbirds again bobbed and gobbled over the ground , but now , gorgeous among them , was a beautiful red cardinal , radiant in its feathered vestments . 
The handsome bird was solitary ; ; 
its mate must be at home , silently guarding their nest . 
She had better stay there , Lucy thought ; ; 
the sly female cowbirds took instant advantage of nests without sentinels . 
Well , Lucy ? ? 
She said to herself , abandoning the cardinals and the cowbirds . 
She had a day of things to do ; ; 
among them , she had to prepare the guest room . 
How long would it be occupied ? ? 
She wondered , with a baffled feeling of helplessness . 
As long as the unscrupulous Myra chose ? ? 
For a moment , her mind returned again to the strange , flying world of birds , and she said to herself . 
It isn't only birds that dump their children in other people's nests . 
In the sunshine of late afternoon , Lucy stood looking at the ready guest room . 
There were new yellow curtains , bright as a child's life ought to be , a new bedspread , lively with hopping rabbits , and hanging from the ceiling was an airy Mother Goose Mobile , spinning slowly in the breeze . 
A row of little hangers waited for a child's clothes in the neatly empty closet ; ; 
since Myra had always put most of Greg's money on her own back , Lucy suspected that no more than a few of that long row would be needed . 
The closet was faintly fragrant with lavender , and as Lucy shut the door an unhappy memory slipped into her mind , like a lavender ghost : Greg's house , on the day he was buried , and the child , pale , silent , baffled , watching the funeral guests with panicky eyes . 
Many times since his death that memory had worried and troubled her . 
Out in the hall , the upstairs phone shrilled , and the small ghost vanished . 
When she picked up the receiver , her mother's cheerful voice was there . 
`` Websterville Junction calling '' , she said . 
`` I just thought I'd let you know . 
Myra dropped Cathy this morning , and Jim picked Cathy up and left Susan a few hours ago . 
I'd have phoned sooner but I've been busy '' . 
`` I can imagine '' ! ! 
Susan was an active character ; ; 
for Mother to be able to call , Susan must be napping now , surrounded by her multitude of dolls . 
Lucy drew out the chair and sat down ; ; 
she relaxed a little , and some of the tension went out of her . 
You could think yourself as grown up as Methuselah , yet the maternal voice still kept its comforting magic . 
`` How was Cathy '' ? ? 
`` Subdued . 
But Myra was the merriest widow I ever saw '' . 
On her way to the airport , on her way to Paris -- you bet , Lucy said to herself . 
`` I've been fixing up the guest room for Cathy '' . 
There was a momentary pause , and then her mother said , `` How long is she supposed to stay '' ? ? 
`` Just for a couple of weeks , till Myra finds a place for them '' . 
`` Well '' -- This time there was a long silence , while the telephone hummed faintly with a voiceless life . 
Puzzled , Lucy stared at the flowered wallpaper ; ; 
her mother was forthright ; ; 
she was not usually given to mysterious silences . 
Was she thinking along the same lines Lucy was -- that it was quite possible Cathy might be left with her for good ? ? 
`` You mean once Myra gets to Paris '' ? ? 
Once the soft , pretty moth found the bright light she had always wanted ? ? 
Suddenly , seekingly , Lucy asked , `` Mother , do you know something I don't know '' ? ? 
Again there was that curious pause , and then her mother said , `` I guess I do . 
Just before Myra left -- She was saying good-by to Cathy , and she didn't realize I was near '' . 
She hesitated , as though hunting over words and ways of putting them . 
`` Cathy was in tears , of course , and I heard Myra say , ' Now be good , and at Christmastime I'll send you a wonderful present from Paris ' '' . 
Shocked speechless , Lucy sat there . 
Then she jumped to her feet , the elastic phone cord uncoiling like a black snake . 
`` Christmastime ! ! 
'' Then it was no bogey she had dreamed up ; ; 
it was only too true . 
Myra had no intention whatever of sending for Cathy in two weeks . 
For a moment , anger darkened the hallway about her , and when she found her voice , anger thickened it . 
`` That does it '' ! ! 
She said . 
`` I'll keep Cathy for two weeks . 
Then , if Myra does nothing about fetching her , I'll pack her right back to her mother -- if I have to take her myself '' ! ! 
Her hand tightened on the receiver . 
`` And that's what I'm going to tell Jim '' . 
For Lucy , the day's nagging to-and-fro had come to an abrupt end . 
As she hung up , she saw through the hall's open window the purple-black flying of the cowbirds' wings , and heard their grotesque singing . 
Cowbird Myra ! ! 
She's not going to get away with it . 
Cathy is tired , Lucy thought , watching them come slowly up the path . 
The child's thin legs were plodding . 
She trudged along slowly , both hands clutching a tired teddy bear . 
She was at the moment just a small , walking package , being delivered to her aunt's and uncle's house . 
Unlike Susan , she was traveling light ; ; 
the worn teddy bear , a tiny suitcase that Jim carried , and the clothes she wore , were all she had . 
Lucy glancing at the miniature case , knew there would not be enough in it for the shortest of stays ; ; 
they would have to buy things for her . 
She opened the door . 
Unimpressed , the dog plopped on the sand . 
Quint couldn't blame Maggie for disbelieving . 
For eleven days they'd done the same thing , leaving the cottage quietly before breakfast , before Esperanza Beach got jammed with tourists and beach balls and show-offy lifeguards . 
The swirling sand made Quint's limp more pronounced . 
They walked slowly past the sherbet-colored cottages -- eleven lemon , nine mint , seven orange -- around the curve to a deserted stand with an `` Eats '' sign jiggling in the wind . 
Now they were in friendly territory . 
Nobody around . 
Nothing but sand and a ridge of rocks sloping jaggedly to the water's edge . 
His rock was to the right of a V-shaped inlet , a big , brown , lumpy rock trailing seaweed whiskers . 
His rock was special because no one on the beach could see him here . 
Here he was enclosed and safe . 
( If a dragon or a sea monster came along , didn't he have a red Swiss hunting knife on his belt -- ten blades and a corkscrew ? ? 
) 
Here was a perfect place to lie down and make believe . 
He was Canute controlling the waves . 
He was a knight of the Round Table , `` Sir Quintus the Brave '' , slaying evil spirits and banshees and vampires and witches with warty noses . 
( One good thing about a suit of armor , his leg wouldn't show . 
) He was the first astronaut on the moon , chosen because of his small size and intrepid nature . 
He was six feet one like his father , with big hands and a hairy chest , a man the weak and persecuted would turn to . 
Fearless . 
Every night when he wanted a drink of water , didn't he practice being fearless by not turning on the bathroom light ? ? 
A dark bathroom can be pretty scary , and he'd creep back to bed , proud of himself , thinking : Tomorrow , for sure , I'll go down to the rock and keep my promise to Dad . 
He hadn't intended to make the promise . 
It happened two weeks ago , the night before his father left on a business trip to South America . 
Every piece of the nightmare was clear , in place ; ; 
and when he woke up , his father was saying , `` Stop screaming , Quint . 
It's all right . 
Stop shaking '' . 
He could remember the feel of his father's big hands , the thump of his father's heart sending out signals -- regular , like radar . 
`` Let's talk about the beach . 
Son . 
While I'm gone you get brown and fat as a pig , hear ? ? 
Look , I can put two fingers between the cords in the back of your neck . 
Dr. Fortman says swimming would help your leg . 
He says you're limping more than you need to '' . 
`` How does he know ? ? 
Big dumb nut . 
He never had polio '' . 
In the light from the bedside table his father looked so worried that the promise spilled out . 
`` You just wait , Dad . 
When you get back I'll probly be swimming better than Victoria . 
Wait and see , Dad '' . 
Victoria was fourteen months younger than Quint , a head taller , and could lick any boy or girl on the beach . 
He called her `` Fatso '' . 
She called him `` Stuck-up -- that's why nobody plays with you , Mister Stuck-up '' . 
Or , what was worse , she prayed for him out loud at bedtime : `` Please , Lord Gord , please give my brother the strength to go swimming like he promised '' . 
`` She's got a nerve '' . 
Quint said now to the clouds . 
Strength began to zip up and down his chest . 
He felt strong as a giant . 
He unlaced his high brown shoes and took off the metal brace on his leg . 
He wadded his sweat shirt into a ball and stripped down to his swimming trunks . 
`` Goolick , goooolick '' , creaked a sea gull . 
`` Aw , shut up '' , he said . 
He stood on the rock , a skinny , dignified boy surrounded by the ocean . 
The wind bored a hole between his shoulder blades , and when he looked at the choppy waves coming and going and crossing each other he could see his head down there , bleeding , wedged between the rocks and the waves . 
I can't go in . 
I'm scared of the nightmare . 
Shivering , he put on his clothes . 
And shivering with shame , he crawled to the narrow end of the rock and spat into the water . 
`` Watch it , big shot '' , a hoarse voice yelled back . 
She was holding on to his rock with one hand . 
She smelled of peppermints . 
She wore a bathing suit like his mother's , no straps on the shouders . 
`` Why didn't you duck '' ? ? 
He snapped . 
`` This is my rock '' . 
`` Isn't '' . 
`` Is '' . 
`` Isn't '' . 
`` Is '' . 
She was sore as a boil . 
`` Ever hear of squatter's rights '' ? ? 
`` Sure . 
They started with the Kansas-Nebraska Bill of eighteen '' -- 
`` Mister Big Britches , aren't you '' ? ? 
`` I'm Mark Gordon Peters the Fifth . 
They call me Quint '' . 
`` Then why don't you stop squinting '' ? ? 
`` I said Quint . 
That's short for Quintus . 
Quintus in Latin means '' -- 
`` I can speak both kinds of Latin , smart aleck '' . 
Her cough sounded like cloth ripping . 
`` You shouldn't smoke so much '' , he said , unconsciously imitating Victoria's holier-than-thou voice . 
`` I don't smoke '' . 
She was horrified . 
`` Do you '' ? ? 
`` Hell , yes '' . 
Not having said `` hell '' before , he stumbled a bit before gathering momentum . 
`` Sometimes eleven , fourteen a day '' . 
`` If I was your mama , I'd wop your tail off '' . 
`` My mother never wops me . 
I've got this leg brace '' . 
She seemed so unimpressed that he was obliged to roll up his blue jeans so she could see his brace . 
`` Dingy-looking '' , was what she said . 
`` Why don't you paint it red and white like a barber pole '' ? ? 
`` Because maybe I won't have to wear it always . 
Dr. Fortman says if I exercise my leg more , maybe I can use a cane when I'm big '' . 
She spouted a mouthful of water into the air . 
`` A cane's mighty handy . 
Someone's walking past , you want to stop him , zoooop , snag him around the neck with the crook in your cane . 
Or say a waiter brings you a bowl of soup with a dead fly in it -- all you got to do is bannnnnng , stooooomp your cane on the floor . 
Hey , will you look at that '' ? ? 
Maggie had shaken himself awake and was licking the sand off his stubby whiskers and his long plume of a tail . 
`` That's some dog . 
What kind '' ? ? 
`` Part collie , part wire-haired terrier '' . 
Quint glared . 
He always did when people asked . 
`` Holy mackerel , that's the most unique dog I ever saw '' , she said firmly . 
`` His real name's DiMaggio , only we call him Maggie because he has to take tranquilizers . 
He's braver than he looks . 
He's been sick lately . 
Last Tuesday he went on a ham jag '' . 
`` A what '' ? ? 
He would have told her , but Victoria was yodeling . 
That meant `` Mama wants you Quint . 
Come home or I'll come find you '' . 
`` I gotta go . 
Even though this is my rock , you can use it sometimes . 
I come early in the morning '' . 
`` So do I . 
See you around , Mister Squint '' . 
That was how they started being friends . 
They met next morning and all the mornings thereafter . 
Same time , early , before the fog burned off , because she didn't like the sun ; ; 
it made her blister . 
Her name was Sabella , and the strip of seaweed around her neck was an emerald necklace the King gave her as a token of his undying love . 
`` You going to marry the King '' ? ? 
`` No . 
He's got a long beard and picks his teeth with a fork . 
My hair is what he's nuts about . 
Naturally curly hair runs in my family . 
Personally , I prefer straight hair like yours , but as they say on the Continent , ' What can one do ' '' ? ? 
`` Which continent '' ? ? 
`` Name one , I been there '' . 
Japan , she said , smelled pugh because people let dead fish lie on the beaches till the fish got hard as rocks ; ; 
then they scraped off the mold and made fish soup . 
Pugh . 
Camels in Tripoli had harelips . 
Near Galway the tinkers drove their caravans down to the beach and sang and drank and fought all night . 
As for dancing -- holy mackerel , he ought to see the gypsies in Jerez ; ; 
they danced on the sand till your blood got hot and danced with them . 
`` Really '' . 
Quint smothered a yawn . 
She made better pictures than any book he'd read , but he didn't say so . 
Artfully , as the days went by , he found occasion to tell her that his father had won the Navy Cross in the Korean War ; ; 
that his baby sister could spit up through her nose when she felt like it ; ; 
that he personally had an IQ of 141 and was currently reading the Mushr to Ozon volume of the encyclopedia . 
`` Books are for schnooks '' . 
She skipped a piece of water at him and laughed , a funny , hoarse laugh he liked to hear . 
Nobody ever appreciated his jokes as much as Sabella . 
( `` What did one tonsil say to the other tonsil ? ? 
Let's get dressed up -- the doctor's taking us out tonight '' . 
And `` What time did the Chinaman go to the dentist ? ? 
Tooth-hurty '' . 
) Encouraged by her giggles he imitated Maggie who was crazy about ham . 
He described the ham decorated with pineapple and cherries , cooling on the porch . 
He snuck up on the ham like Maggie , gumming it with soft , stumpy teeth , then panting with thirst , lapping up the water in the lagoon , swelling up like a balloon , staggering home to be sick , while his mother said , `` That does it . 
That dog has to go '' . 
`` Say , you're quite a comic '' , Sabella said admiringly . 
`` Ever thought about going on the stage '' ? ? 
He hadn't . 
But it was such a nice thought that he nodded his head . 
`` Either that or a veterinarian '' . 
`` Better make up your mind , son '' , Sabella said . 
`` You can't serve cod and salmon '' . 
Sometimes they argued . 
She said sharks have no bones and shrimp swam backward . 
His encylopedia agreed with Sabella . 
Next morning he tied a bunch of sea daisies with string and threw them across the V-shaped inlet to the rock where she was swimming around . 
Boy , could she catch ! ! 
Like Willie Mays in the outfield . 
`` Nobody gave me flowers before . 
Thank you , Quint '' . 
Her face turned pink with pleasure and a smothered cough . 
`` You can always tell a real gentleman -- they got a certain je ne say quok '' . 
Sometimes they didn't talk at all . 
He daydreamed on the rock while she swam and splashed around . 
Once when she asked why he never went swimming and he answered , `` Don't feel like it '' , he was tempted to tell her about being scared . 
But Victoria began yodeling just then and he went home , carrying Sabella in the back of his head , not thinking about her , just knowing she was there , smiling , smelling of peppermints . 
As for his promise -- oh , he had plenty of time , buckets of time . 
Wednesday morning it happened . 
They were eating breakfast . 
`` We beseech thee , Lord Gord , to bless this food '' -- that was Victoria saying grace while the baby sprayed raisin toast on her plastic bib . 
Same old breakfast till the phone rang , making his mother's voice shake with excitement . 
`` Your Daddy's in San Francisco '' , she told them . 
`` He says he'll be here on the one-o'clock plane . 
Fifteen days early -- isn't that wonderful '' ? ? 
`` Yeah , keen '' . 
A cave seemed to be opening in Quint's stomach . 
`` Children , we'll have to get organized . 
The baby can have an early nap . 
Victoria , I want you to -- '' 
Quint closed the screen door quietly so Maggie wouldn't be scared . 
`` Hurry up , we're late '' , he said , noticing with a chill how gray the sky was this morning , the fog like a rope along the horizon , the choppy waves sending off sheets of blue and Kool-Aid green . 
The cave in his stomach hurt . 
He had to go into the water . 
He'd tell Sabella about the nightmare . 
It had started two years ago when he was in an iron lung . 
What caused it , he didn't know . 
The metal collar gagging his neck ? ? 
Sweating so much ? ? 
The unbearable weight on his chest ? ? 
All of it together meant drowning . 
The first time the nurse took him out of the lung , she said if he got frightened , she'd put him back for a second . 
When Bobbie Evans smashed up his car , the Jaguar his wife Linda had given him for his last birthday , and himself quite thoroughly with it , driving back from an afternoon's golf at Oakmont , it seemed to mark the end of a long , miswritten chapter in the social life of the community . 
Linda looked remote yet lovely in black , and everyone held his or her breath . 
Not that Linda was heartless , not that she would do anything prematurely or in bad taste any more than John Cooper would . 
Hadn't Linda been a perfect wife to Bobbie , who was the least bit of a disappointment all these years ? ? 
Wasn't John Cooper even more attractive at forty-seven than he had been twenty-five years earlier ? ? 
And wasn't John's wife , Edythe , even more appalling , if possible ? ? 
Didn't John Cooper , after all this time , deserve something better of life ? ? 
Wasn't it adult and realistic to look at it that way ? ? 
And romantic ? ? 
Everybody knew that John Cooper had married Edythe on the rebound . 
It was the kind of thing that could ruin a man's life , and it was a tribute to John's strength of character and very real business ability that it hadn't ruined his . 
`` Of course , there was nothing you could do , but you still ought to be ashamed of yourself for letting it happen '' , Mousie Chandler said to Linda Stuart . 
`` Poor John '' ! ! 
Linda accepted the reproach , which was something she did rarely in all her life and most rarely in that summer of 1936 when she was by all odds the prettiest and brightest young woman west of the Allegheny Mountains , and John was surely one of the handsomer and brighter young men around Pittsburgh . 
For it had been John and Linda ever since she had come out two seasons before at the Golf Club to the goggle-eyed admiration not only of the stag line but even of her fellow debs . 
John had claimed her from the stag line , a young man a year out of Dartmouth with skiing crinkles still around his eyes . 
You saw them always together those years . 
You talked about John-and-Linda as an entity . 
John-and-Linda were at Longue Vue last night ; ; 
John-and-Linda drove to Conneaut in three and a half hours . 
Then there was a spat over something , as there had been lovers' spats before ; ; 
only this one didn't heal . 
You still said `` John-and-Linda '' , but as if you were speaking of a national catastrophe such as the depression or Dillinger . 
It got worse instead of better . 
First , it came out after Mr. Cooper's will was settled -- he had died the year before -- that John and his mother weren't rich any more . 
And then there was Linda's engagement to Bobbie Evans . 
There was no connection between the two events , because Bobbie wasn't rich , either , though he was more aggressive than John . 
He was a bright and handsome young man from New York , who worked for the same steel company as John did . 
Some people said Linda had just announced the engagement to jolt John into some action , but when John came home from a business trip to Cleveland with Edythe , with Edythe his bride , it could no longer be John-and-Linda even to sentimental wishful thinkers . 
It wasn't even John and Edythe . 
It was simply Poor John . 
There was nothing specifically wrong with Edythe , but there was absolutely nothing right about her either . 
Mousie Chandler had been to school with her someplace near Baltimore and tried to explain rather than defend her to the gang having lunch at Horne's . 
`` Well , you shouldn't underestimate Edythe '' , Mousie said . 
`` I know she gives the impression of being shallow and frivolous and scatterbrained . 
She is frivolous and scatterbrained , but she really isn't shallow '' . 
Bobbie and Linda looked magnificent at their wedding . 
John was at the church with Edythe . 
She giggled during the ceremony , and Mousie Chandler , who was one of Linda's bridesmaids , said John glared black as death at her . 
`` As if he were choking '' , she said . 
`` Poor John '' ! ! 
Edythe settled down to become a social myth and a horrible example . 
Her hair never seemed to be in place and her skirts were never quite the correct length . 
She didn't have a bad shape when you caught her at the pool at Longue Vue , but her bathing suits were far from smart . 
And you didn't see her much at Longue Vue or anywhere , for John had drifted away from the gang . 
Mousie said it was because he was too proud to stand pity . 
Others thought he couldn't stand seeing Linda , Mrs. Bobbie Evans , still so beautiful , so much in command of everything . 
There were less-dramatic reasons too . 
John's mother died not long after his marriage , and there was even less Cooper money left . 
John sold the big old place in Sewickley and bought a smaller house in Fox Chapel . 
He was not reduced to poverty , but his job at the steel company had become a real job and not a method of passing the day . 
John was good at his job . 
It probably wasn't hard for him to keep his nose to the grindstone with nothing but Edythe to come home to . 
Though that may be unfair since Ben Cooper , John's first son , came along early in 1938 , the cutest baby you ever saw and a blessing that he looked all Cooper from fontanel to pink toes , nary a trace of Edythe . 
But the continuing charm of the other children -- Sally in 1940 and Jack in 1944 -- and all John's success at his work only made Edythe's dizziness and general uselessness more glaring . 
She never could fit into a crowd which had known , which still knew and admired Linda . 
When there was bridge at Edythe's house , the cards shuffled like wet graham crackers and the food probably was wet graham crackers . 
She managed a missionary drive for the church once and got the books so confused that old Mr. Webber , the eldest elder , who'd never donated more than five dollars to anything , had to cough up five hundred dollars to avoid a scandal in what Edythe called `` the bosoms of the church '' . 
John did find the missing checks and money afterward , and the drive was actually oversubscribed , which was a real bit of luck for the missionaries . 
Being an intelligent man , John must have guessed what everyone thought about Edythe , but he never let on by so much as a brave smile . 
Poor John was the kind of stock that keeps a bargain without whimpering and maybe bends over backward to keep a bad one . 
He was an attentive and generous husband , overgenerous , a lot of people felt , because they knew that money must be a problem to him . 
But he got ahead in business : on leave from his job to an important Washington assignment during the war ; ; 
after the war back to the heir apparency of the steel company . 
The Coopers saw Bobbie and Linda socially , but no more than was necessary . 
Bobbie had been successful , too , though he didn't match John's pace , and after all he didn't need to , with all the Stuart money . 
He and Linda settled down to being social leaders , and Linda managed to look a little more beautiful each year . 
And then came the hairpin turn , the smashed Jaguar and Linda , mourning alone and lovely . 
Everyone held his or her breath . 
`` Don't think Linda couldn't have got John back any time , if she'd tried '' , Mousie Gordon , who had been Mousie Chandler , said between bites of a chicken sandwich at a luncheon table at Le Mont . 
`` Now you know she could've , but she isn't that kind of girl . 
But now -- well , it would be a blessing , I think . 
Poor John '' . 
Linda Evans felt more wretched than she had ever dreamed Bobbie's death could move her to feeling . 
What she felt was a bone-deep loss with a sense of waste to it , not so much sorrow for handsome , ambitious Bobbie , but for the lost years that had been brought into high relief by his death . 
She knew what people were thinking ; ; 
it was what she had been thinking herself . 
It was up to her to save Poor John , dear John , to undo the wrong she had done , but she trembled at the decision as at the brink of a cold stream . 
There was no one who would blame her or John ; ; 
she could be sure of that . 
It might be rough on Edythe at first , but Linda and John between them could make a settlement handsome enough to soothe her , to send her back to Cleveland or anywhere . 
And Linda felt capable of capturing the affection of the children , anxious even , since she and Bobbie had had none of their own . 
It would be good for them to have a mother they need not be ashamed of . 
Linda would have to wait , she knew . 
But what was a decent six months or so after the more than twenty years gone by ? ? 
Years of watching while Poor John struggled without the help and understanding of the kind of wife a man needed to get ahead . 
Of course , he had done wonders . 
Alloy steels and regular steels had different sales departments at Smith & MacIsaacs , where John and Bobbie both worked . 
Bobbie had been head of the alloy division , while John was just another good salesman in the regular branch . 
So when old Mr. Lovejoy , the company president , talked about putting in a single sales manager for both branches after the head of the regular steels had gone with Carnegie-Illinois , it looked like the perfect chance for Bobbie . 
For Linda knew how to help her husband , not just the Stuart-family contacts but also the little dinners for Reuben Lovejoy . 
She was almost sick when Bobbie came home with the news that Poor John had won the job . 
`` What did you do '' ? ? 
She asked Bobbie . 
`` You must have done something , something wrong . 
Lord knows I had everything set for you '' . 
Bobbie said something about damned Pittsburghers sticking together , and Linda got angry at him . 
They had their first real fight , and Bobbie went off to get drunk . 
Linda dragooned her uncle , Donald Murkland , into a lunch the next day to find out what had happened . 
He was a director of S. & M. and must have been in on the decision . 
But jolly old Uncle Donald would tell her no more than that Bobbie had certainly been considered for the job , but there were factors in a large company which outsiders and even some insiders couldn't understand . 
He didn't tell her of the long board meeting where Bobbie and John were weighed one against the other . 
`` I'm behind John Cooper '' , Mr. Lovejoy said finally . 
`` I think we're agreed that he and Evans are equal in ability , so we have to look at the thing in terms of incentive . 
`` Now , I believe Poor John'll work just a little harder . 
With that wife of his , I think he feels every chance he gets is his big chance . 
Bobbie , with Linda behind him , will have plenty of other opportunities . 
And also , the money can't mean as much to Bobbie . 
`` Bobbie will take the job as his just reward and work hard at it ; ; 
Poor John will take it as a miracle and have every other independent steel company sitting up nights worrying about us '' . 
Most of the directors nodded . 
Uncle Donald Murkland found himself nodding agreement too . 
After the surprise was over , Linda was almost as pleased as anyone with John's good luck , though she agreed with Bobbie's decision some months later to move to Funk Furnaces . 
The job at Funk wasn't particularly better , but it got him away from being subordinate to John and assured him steady advancement , since Funk was owned to a large degree by various branches of Linda's family . 
Poor John's rise continued to be meteoric . 
When he was made a vice president only a year after the new sales job , a leading business magazine ran his photograph with a brief biography in a series on national business leaders of the future . 
She called then to say she had a baby-sitter for that night . 
`` Shirley appreciated the chance to make some money . 
Such a nice little thing -- lives right in the building '' . 
`` That's swell '' , I said sweetly . 
I could get along without that three dollars . 
In some ways it was worth being out the money -- just knowing I was no longer obligated to Nadine ! ! 
It was past midnight and we were in bed when the phone rang . 
I stumbled through the hall , wondering who would be calling at this hour . 
I answered to find Nadine at the other end . 
`` You scared me half to death '' , I said shakily . 
`` What's wrong '' ? ? 
`` Janice , nobody answers at the apartment '' ! ! 
Her voice came shrill . 
`` I'm absolutely frantic ! ! 
That stupid girl might have gone off and left Francie '' ! ! 
`` Oh , she wouldn't do that '' , I said . 
`` She's probably fallen asleep and doesn't hear the phone . 
But if you're worried you can go home and check '' -- 
`` I can't leave the party ! ! 
We're at Ken Thom's apartment , and when one couple leaves early everything falls flat ! ! 
Old Mr. Thom is already down on Wally , and we simply can't afford to get Ken mad at us '' -- 
I was all set for what came next . 
`` Janice , could you possibly go over and make sure everything's all right ? ? 
I'll call you there in ten minutes '' -- 
`` I can't make it in ten minutes '' -- Wondering , as I said it , why I should make it at all . 
Why should I go over at midnight to check on Francie , when her parents didn't care enough to leave a party ? ? 
`` Fifteen minutes , then ! ! 
Please , Janice . 
I'll be glad to pay you '' -- 
So sure that money could do anything ! ! 
`` All right '' , I said . 
I'd do it . 
Not for the dollar or so Nadine would give me . 
But because there was the chance that something had gone wrong at the apartment , and if I didn't go over , who would ? ? 
Chris was sound asleep , and I didn't see any sense in waking him . 
I dressed in the kitchen , then left a note on the table telling him what had happened . 
I drove off through the cool darkness to Nadine's apartment and rang the bell , and in a few seconds a young girl opened the door . 
Her face was flushed from sleep . 
`` It's all right '' , I said , as she started to look scared . 
`` Mrs. Roberts had called , and couldn't wake you . 
I just came over to make sure everything was all right '' . 
`` I'm -- hard to wake up '' , she faltered . 
She didn't look over thirteen . 
And Nadine insisted that her sitters be reliable ! ! 
`` I have to get up early for church tomorrow '' , she went on . 
`` I didn't know it was going to be this late '' ! ! 
The phone started ringing . 
`` That's Mrs. Roberts again '' , I said . 
`` I'll answer it '' . 
I crossed the beautifully furnished living room to the pale yellow phone . 
I told Nadine everything was fine , and that I'd be getting on home . 
`` Janice , would you mind staying '' ? ? 
There was a ragged edge to her voice now , as if she'd been crying . 
`` Wally's drunk -- I'll get him out of here as soon as I possibly can , but I don't want Shirley to see him like this . 
You know how gossip of that sort spreads through an apartment building '' -- 
Not a word of thanks for what I'd already done . 
The receiver clicked in my ear . 
She didn't even give me a chance to refuse . 
Well , there wasn't any law that said I had to stay ! ! 
But then I looked at Shirley and thought that I might as well -- the child needed her sleep , and Heaven knew what kind of a mess it would be , with Wally coming home drunk . 
So I told her Mrs. Roberts would pay her in the morning , and she scooted off to her own apartment . 
After I looked in at Francie , I went into the living room and waited . 
I must have dozed off , because I came to with a start at the sound of voices . 
Nadine's , shrill with anger -- Wally's loud and thick -- As I went to the door I heard the clock strike two . 
I opened the door , and Wally stumbled in -- fast -- as if Nadine had pushed him . 
I had always thought she was so beautiful . 
But now she looked ugly . 
Her skin was stretched so tight that her cheekbones stuck out , and if looks could kill , Wally would have been dead . 
`` Pack your clothes '' , she hissed . 
`` Pack -- and get out '' ! ! 
`` You're crazy '' , Wally said thickly . 
He lurched and stumbled to the davenport and sank down on it , and was instantly asleep . 
Nadine strode over to him , and her pointed nails raked across his face . 
I grabbed her arm and she turned on me and for a scared second I thought that maybe Wally was right , and she was crazy . 
`` You stay out of this '' , she spat at me . 
`` He's ruined us -- do you hear me -- he's ruined us ! ! 
He insulted Ken Thom '' ! ! 
Her eyes were wild . 
`` He told Ken to his face that he doesn't have what it takes to get a woman ! ! 
And the other people there were listening ! ! 
We're ruined and he's going to get out if I have to throw him down the stairs '' -- 
`` you'd better simmer down '' , I said nervously . 
I was plenty scared . 
In the state she was in , she could actually kill him ! ! 
`` Now you just take it easy , and I'll make you some tea '' -- 
`` Tea , '' Nadine screeched . 
`` How can you be so damn stupid ? ? 
Wally's lost his job ! ! 
Ken will never forgive him -- never ! ! 
And we don't have any money -- we don't have a dime ! ! 
All we own is Francie's bedroom set and the televison-record player and we even owe on them . 
And we'll be poor and have to live in a grubby little house like yours -- and all because of that '' -- 
I clamped my hand over her mouth to stop the stream of filth . 
`` Stop that ! ! 
You'll wake up the whole building . 
Wally can't go any place at this hour '' -- 
`` Well then , I'll get out '' -- But she looked uncertain . 
She was coming to her senses enough to realize that you don't go traipsing off anywhere at two in the morning . 
`` You go to bed '' , I said curtly . 
`` In the morning you and Wally can talk things out '' -- 
She collapsed against me , as if everything inside her snapped . 
I got her into bed , and sat with her until she had sobbed herself out . 
It was three o'clock before I figured it was all right to go . 
I left her , a limp bundle of self-pity , shivering with terror because her bubble had burst around her . 
Wally was snoring on the davenport . 
I had done all I could . 
I had done all I was going to do . 
Whether or not Wally lost his job was no concern of mine . 
I drove home , found Chris still asleep . 
I snuggled up close to him -- loving him -- thankful for a man like him . 
Thankful I wasn't Nadine . 
I kept on being thankful . 
In the afternoon Nadine and Wally came over with Francie . 
Wally sat in our big chair , his hands between his knees , looking ready to cry . 
`` I'd had all this trouble with the old man , that's why I drank so much . 
I -- got fired yesterday for not attending to business '' -- 
Old Mr. Thom himself had stopped at the service station for a grease job , Wally confessed , and couldn't get one because there were cars on the pits waiting to be repaired . 
Seems that the kid Wally had hired had a repair business of his own going on the side . 
Mr. Thom had gotten Wally on the phone , and fired him . 
`` I thought I'd smooth things over through Ken '' , Wally said miserably . 
`` But Ken got coy and wouldn't make any promises . 
And I was plastered and I blew my stack '' -- 
`` And told him right to his face he'd never slept with a woman '' ! ! 
I tried to quiet Nadine because the children were there . 
But she was beyond caring what she said . 
`` Things may smooth over yet '' , Chris said , his nice lean face grave with honest concern . 
But I couldn't help thinking that Nadine and Wally were getting just what they deserved . 
Now maybe they'd realize that life can be tough . 
When A bubble breaks , there's nothing . 
Little by little , during the week , Chris and I discovered the crazy unbelievable way Nadine and Wally had lived . 
They had not only spent every cent -- they were in debt up to their necks , owing on everything they owned . 
On top of everything else they were two months behind on their apartment rent , and the day Wally received written notice that he was fired , they were evicted . 
Worst of all , Wally had no training for any kind of work . 
He had fallen into a soft job , and now the job was gone and he was stranded . 
Chris fretted . 
`` I wish we were in a position to offer a little money to tide them over '' . 
I said I wished we were , too . 
It was easy enough to say it , because of course we couldn't spare a cent . 
But Chris brightened up like a candle . 
`` I'm glad you feel that way , honey . 
There is one big way we can help them . 
We can let them move in with us '' -- 
Something I had simply never thought of . 
Something so incredible -- 
I just stared at him . 
It was incredible -- He gave me an embarrassed , pleading look . 
`` I know we'd be pretty crowded . 
But it would only be for a couple of weeks -- until they get straightened out '' . 
Straightened out -- They'd had years of making all that money ! ! 
`` I won't do it '' , I said flatly . 
`` Nadine was always too good to live in a little house like this ! ! 
Well , now she can sleep in the street for all I care '' ! ! 
`` That isn't like you , Janice '' , Chris said uncomfortably . 
Then I felt uncomfortable , too . 
I didn't want to be like that , mean and bitter . 
But , darn it all , why should we help a couple of spoiled snobs who had looked down their noses at us ? ? 
But , in the end , we did . 
It just seemed as if there was nothing else to do . 
The finance company took all their furniture -- and they didn't have a cent to their name . 
Then Wally got sick . 
To my way of thinking , he was scared sick . 
His luck had failed him , and it was easier to crawl off into bed than to get out and fight the world . 
Chris made trip after trip in our old car , moving the clothes and dishes and the stock of groceries Nadine had bought on special . 
At least we'll eat , I thought grimly as I put all the food away . 
While I worked , Nadine sat and cried . 
When she wasn't crying , she was in our bedroom fighting with Wally . 
`` Virus infection nothing '' , she'd scream at him . 
`` You're too lazy to go out and look for another job . 
You're just a no-good bum '' ! ! 
It was a mess , all right . 
But it couldn't go on forever -- A couple of weeks , Chris had said . 
I figured I could stand practically anything for a couple of weeks . 
But the two weeks dragged into three , and they were still with us . 
Nadine's constant nagging had finally gotten Wally out of bed . 
He set out every morning looking for work , and come home around noon , full of alibis and excuses . 
Wendell Thom had black-balled him . 
Nobody would even take his application . 
`` You can get something , '' Nadine would snap . 
`` You can get a job working in a grocery store , if nothing else '' . 
`` The high school kids have got everything sewed up '' , he said , a whine in his voice . 
`` Those damn punks -- taking work away from men who need it '' . 
`` By fall they'll be back in school '' , I'd say , trying to sound encouraging . 
But this was only the middle of July . 
And I couldn't take six more weeks of this . 
I mentioned it to Chris one stifling hot night , when I had slipped outside for a breath of fresh air . 
I don't really believe in intuition . 
But I swear to you from the moment I opened my eyes , I knew it was going to be a bad day . 
Part of it was the weather , so foggy it would take me twice as long to get to the hospital . 
Part of it was being so tired -- I'd not only had my usual full day yesterday , but a dinner meeting as well , that kept me up late . 
But the rest of it , the main part , wasn't based on logic at all . 
It was just going to be one of those days . 
For the thousandth time , I wished I'd chosen some nice , nine-to-five , five-days-a-week profession . 
And for the thousandth time , I answered myself . 
I hadn't chosen medicine -- it had chosen me . 
Actually , I shouldn't complain , I told myself in the shaving mirror . 
I had a lot to be thankful for . 
A profession that brought me as good an income as mine wasn't to be sneezed at . 
Maybe I didn't see as much of Gladdy as I'd like , but how much worse it would have been if I'd had to board her out somewhere after Alice went -- send my daughter to an orphanage or a boarding-home . 
At least , we were together and we had Mrs. Hodges , bless her , to look after us -- no mother could be fonder of Gladdy than Mrs. Hodges was . 
I was lucky in lots of ways , no doubt about it . 
Especially in the way Gladdy had turned out . 
Growing up without a mother from the time she was three -- it wasn't a good thing for a child , even knowing the kind of mother Alice had been . 
But I mustn't start on Alice . 
She is a closed book , a picture I keep on my bureau , but never look at . 
If she'd kept on as she'd been going , the story I'd told Gladdy would probably have been true by now , anyhow 
As usual , Gladdy's bright smile greeted me at the breakfast table . 
Her first class wasn't until ten , but she always got up to have breakfast with me . 
It made me feel good and knowing that she'd decided , all on her own , to go to college right here in town made me feel good , too . 
Oh , I knew that I couldn't give myself all the credit for her decision . 
I had a feeling that young Pete Michelson , the most promising intern at Fairview , had something to do with it , too . 
She'd been out with Pete the night before and her gay chatter about their date lightened my mood a little . 
But once I was alone again , driving to the hospital , the heaviness returned . 
If she and Pete were really getting serious , I'd have to do some hard thinking . 
Should I tell him the truth about Alice ? ? 
Did he have a right to know the secret I'd kept from Gladdy all these years ? ? 
The boys were already waiting in the corridor outside my office when I got to Fairview . 
Two interns and Dick Ishii , the other resident . 
I'm Chief of Medicine here and this morning would start like all others , with me taking the boys on the rounds . 
Pete was down on Seven , Dick told me , and he'd meet us there . 
There wasn't anything of special interest that morning , no one sicker than they should have been . 
Pete came to meet us when we stepped out of the elevator on Seven -- he'd had a case of post-operative shock , but it was all taken care of now . 
Seven is a women's floor and , as it happened , not very busy right then . 
When we'd finished our regular rounds , Pete pointed me toward the small ward at the end of the floor . 
`` Got a new one in last night '' , he said . 
`` I haven't seen her yet , but I hear she's a lulu '' ! ! 
I wasn't surprised . 
The ward was a small one , four beds , kept reserved for female alcoholics . 
We didn't get many at Fairview and they were never pretty sights . 
It was thought wiser to keep them segregated from the patients in the regular charity ward . 
The moment I walked in , the whole miserable feeling of the day seemed to focus on the woman in the bed . 
They'd cleaned her up some , of course , and she'd pretty much slept off her drunk . 
But there was something about her -- and I felt my lips forming a name . 
Alice But this woman's name was Rose Bancroft ! ! 
I looked at the chart for reassurance . 
Yes , Rose Bancroft , diagnosis : acute alcoholism . 
She looked about sixty , though I recalled that the chart gave her age as forty-four . 
An ugly scar disfigured the somewhat familiar puffy face , already marred by the tell-tale network of broken red veins that heavy drinkers carry . 
Her coarse hair was two-colored -- bleached blonde and its real , dirty gray . 
Oh , could it be ? ? 
No , no it was an unfortunate resemblance , that was all it was , and I turned to Dick , forcing myself to put my disquiet out of my mind . 
In a low voice , Dick filled us in 
she'd been picked up downtown , passed out in the doorway . 
Although quiet when they brought her in , she'd suddenly turned violent and had to be knocked out . 
It was the old story . 
We'd keep her a day or two , and the AA people would talk to her . 
But if she wasn't interested , she'd just go back to the same life she'd left . 
Turning toward the patient again , I -- I can't describe what happened to me then , except to say that I felt sick . 
I tell you , it took every ounce of control I had to be able to speak . 
`` Now , Miss -- or is it Mrs. Bancroft '' ? ? 
I never liked going straight into an examination with patients -- it relaxes them , I've always thought , to chat first . 
This was one time I'd have gladly broken my own rule , but habit was too strong . 
`` Hey '' ! ! 
Her voice was flat and dull . 
But those penetrating eyes -- I had to turn my head away . 
It was then that I saw what the drawn-back covers revealed . 
There were bloodspots on the sheet . 
`` What's this '' ? ? 
I asked . 
`` Your period '' ? ? 
She shook her head . 
`` I been spotting a little now and then '' , she said quietly , no emotion in her voice . 
`` Have you spoken to a doctor about it '' ? ? 
Once again , there was a negative shake . 
I told Miss Groggins to move her down the hall where we had an examining table . 
`` Better do a Papanicolaou '' , I told Pete . 
It was only a few moments before Miss Groggins had her in the proper position for a vaginal , but I couldn't see anything wrong on gross examination . 
Pete stood by with a slide and took the smear , sent it down to the lab with a request for the test . 
That done , I told Miss Groggins to take her patient back to bed and again put her out of my mind . 
I was busy the rest of the day . 
Late in the afternoon , I was up on Seven again . 
One of my private patients was being admitted and I went in to see her settled . 
On my way to the elevator , I ran into Pete . 
`` I've got the results on the Bancroft smear test '' , he said . 
`` There's something there , all right . 
Class Three , they said . 
Do you want to talk to her , Doctor '' ? ? 
`` Well '' -- I didn't -- I didn't ever want to see that woman again . 
But that was ridiculous , of course . 
`` All right . 
We'll do a D. and C. and get her permission for a hysterectomy . 
Maybe it's nothing , maybe it's intraepithelial or in situ -- can't take any chances '' . 
`` If you can keep her here that long '' , Pete said wryly . 
`` Groggins tells me she's started badgering already , wants to get out . 
Wants to get to her booze , I guess '' . 
I grimaced in distaste . 
`` Well , better see what I can do '' . 
We'd been standing right outside Miss Bancroft's door and as I went to turn the knob to enter , I was surprised to find that the door was slightly ajar . 
But she seemed to be dozing and in any case , we'd been talking in low tones . 
Her eyes opened as soon as she heard me , though , and once again , I felt an inward shiver . 
`` I sure can't complain about the service in this place '' , she said . 
`` I just got through seeing one of you guys . 
What do you want '' ? ? 
There was something almost insulting in her tone , but I disregarded it . 
`` I've just been talking to Dr. Michelson '' , I said . 
`` We'd like you to have a dilatation and curettage . 
That's quite minor , nothing to worry about . 
But we would like your permission to do -- that is , to go further if it proves necessary '' . 
`` No '' . 
It was flat , definite . 
`` Suppose you let me explain . 
Actually , I rather doubt that we'll have to do this . 
Even if we do , you'll be out of here in a week , probably '' . 
I was sure that was the difficulty -- she just didn't want to stay here , where she couldn't get to the liquor . 
`` No '' . 
I looked at her in amazement . 
I'd had patients who'd refused surgery before , of course , but never one who didn't show , in one way or another , the reason why . 
Mostly , it was fear , but this woman's voice didn't tremble and her hands were still on the coverlet . 
`` Will you tell me why '' ? ? 
I asked . 
She smiled , a smile without humor . 
`` You shouldn't tell your little secrets outside of the patient's door '' , she said . 
`` I've got cancer , haven't I '' ? ? 
She went on , disregarding my protests . 
`` I'm not going to be one of your guinea pigs . 
Let your pupils learn on someone else , Doctor . 
Just let me die in peace '' . 
I stared at her , almost speechless . 
Her little speech was totally out of character with the sort of person I thought she was . 
Even her voice had taken on a more cultivated tone . 
This was someone who'd come down in the world , I thought . 
A long , long way down . 
Again there was something familiar about her , something -- 
`` You haven't got cancer '' , I said as strongly as I could . 
`` I don't know what you heard that would make you think so , but I assure you I don't even know myself , so how can you be so sure ? ? 
And even if '' -- 
`` Don't give me a lot of talk , Joe '' . 
I gaped at her . 
She could have found out my first name , of course -- that wouldn't be difficult . 
But there was that something , some echo in the way she spoke . 
She was watching me intently , a funny little half-smile on her lips . 
`` Surprised , baby ? ? 
Guess I've changed , haven't I ? ? 
But you haven't changed much , Joe '' . 
I knew then , knew with a heart-stopping shock . 
`` Alice '' -- I stammered through dry lips . 
`` Alice , for goodness sake '' -- 
`` Alice '' , she echoed mockingly . 
`` What's the matter , Joe , you scared of me ? ? 
Think I'm going to make you introduce a drunk as your wife ? ? 
Well , don't worry . 
Just let me outta here '' -- 
`` But why did you come back '' ? ? 
I'd found my voice . 
`` Where have you been all these years '' ? ? 
She shrugged . 
`` Here and there . 
As for coming back here -- well , I'll tell you the truth , I didn't even know where I was when I came to . 
The last thing I remember is a bar in San Diego '' -- 
The way she spoke , her flat acceptance of her alcoholic blackout , made me shudder . 
And this was Gladdy's mother ! ! 
`` I never asked you for any favors , Joe '' , she went on , `` but I'm asking one now . 
Let me outta here ! ! 
You doctors are all alike -- all you want is to cut up people and what's the good ? ? 
No , I want out , Joe '' ! ! 
I looked at the pathetic wreck of a woman before me . 
Let her out , let her out -- that would be the solution , wouldn't it ? ? 
What she'd said was true -- in all these years , she'd never asked for anything from me . 
If I let her go , she'd disappear once more . 
And Gladdy would be safe ! ! 
I was slowly swimming down to the bottom of the sea . 
She made me welcome . 
Her dark cool caresses were sweeter than any woman's ; ; 
the many little tricks she knew made her embrace the ultimate one -- the ever more fantastic pressures deeper in her body squeezed not me but the air I breathed into a nitrogen anesthetic . 
yielding-Mediterranian-woman- , she soothed me , and drew me deeper into her . 
I no longer knew how deep I was , somewhere under 230 feet , getting drunker , happier and more contented by the second . 
The reasons for this dive seemed foolish now . 
Only the dive itself had any meaning . 
The metal-tasting nitrogen made me wonder if I should remove the mouthpiece and suck in the sweet water . 
Perhaps if I took off the aqua-lung I could swim better , love my woman better . 
I chuckled aloud , and the mouthpiece fell out . 
While a hazy part of my mind concentrated on swimming down , a clear part sorted over recent events , among them my only positive act in a long time . 
It was when I packed up what duds I had and went to Paris . 
It was no vacation , just me getting out after a bellyfull . 
I knew it wouldn't be the same . 
Wild kicks never are , but I hoped to dig up a better frame of mind . 
Once before I had been to Paris , long before I married Valery . 
That first time was good and it stuck with me . 
I was twenty-one back then , in the army , and fog put our plane down at Orly instead of Rhine-Main . 
It was a Saturday evening in April with a mist-like rain , and I was a little high on the good taste of life . 
I had a pocketful of money , which was unusual when I was in the army , and the plane would be grounded all night . 
In less than an hour I had gotten a hotel , showered , shaved and was out on the Champs Elysees in a fresh uniform . 
I felt like a Hun in Rome . 
All the women were beautiful , and the men were equal to them ; ; 
everything was glamorous to my dazzled eyes . 
There were some sweet machines other than women : an old Bugatti , a lean Farina coachwork on an American chassis , a Swallow , a type A40-AjK Mercedes and lots more . 
There was the Arc de Triomphe and the Tour d'Eiffel -- I was no yokel , but I was young , and this was Paris ! ! 
I had champagne at Maxim's , then went into a cafe called the Jour et Nuit to ask the way to Montmartre . 
I never got there . 
I met Claire , which was better . 
She was eating bread and cheese just as fast as she possibly could , and washing it down with red wine . 
I stared . 
I didn't know a human could feed so fast and still be beautiful . 
She was blonde , and young , and nice and round in a tight white dress . 
Maybe her ravenous eating wasn't grotesque because she was so positive about it . 
When she had drained the last of the bottle and paid her bill , she came directly to my table and said : 
`` Handsome soldier , I have assuaged one hunger with food . 
I feel another of terrible urgency . 
Is your evening free '' ? ? 
`` Madame '' , I said with noblesse oblige because of the `` handsome '' -- `` yeah '' . 
And so off we went to her apartment . 
She was a nymphomaniac , of course , the poor girl . 
Toward the break of day I waxed philosophical , and drew analogies about her way of eating bread and cheese . 
Now it was nine years later , and it wasn't spring but winter when I returned . 
I got there on a Saturday evening . 
I made the mistake of going to the Jour et Nuit . 
The place was busy but I didn't feel like a Hun . 
I sat waiting for Life to come along and sweep me up . 
I had part of a bottle of French beer called Panther Pils ( so help me ) , then switched to Tuborg . 
After a few hours , Life hadn't showed , and I was crocked . 
I went to my hotel and slept . 
The next morning a little cognac made me feel better -- but what can you do in Paris on Sunday morning ? ? 
So I drank more cognac . 
All that day and Monday I drank just enough to orbit but not make deep space . 
I read the Tropic of Capricorn and the Tropic of Cancer . 
Elemental , but sex . 
That's what was on my mind . 
I was turning over the idea of a good debauchery when I dozed off . 
I felt better Tuesday evening when I woke up . 
My head was clear , my thinking sober and I was reconciled to this Paris idea as a flop on top of all my others . 
A good binge has that kind of therapeutic value . 
Sometime earlier the weather had turned cold and it was snowing . 
I went out into it . 
I walked around breathing the cold wine of the air until I found a park , and I sat down on a snowy bench where the light was dim and came from the sky . 
There was dignity and beauty in the little white flakes falling through the blue night . 
I had on only a topcoat , but I wasn't cold . 
I was just miserable . 
Pretty soon a woman came along carrying a folded umbrella as a walking stick . 
She saw me and sat down beside me , three feet away . 
Suddenly I understood why she had the umbrella . 
It gave her poise and posture . 
Without it she would have been drab and limp . 
It gave her propriety . 
It gave her the right to sit down beside me , back straight , one hand out on the handle . 
I couldn't imagine her without it . 
I knew all about her . 
She was another human being and happened to be a hustler . 
I didn't much care if she were there or not . 
After a while she said with sort of an unuttered laugh , `` You have snow in your hair and ears '' . 
( I didn't have on a hat . 
) 
Hardly glancing at her , I smiled a bleak one which said , Thanks , baby , but I'd rather be alone . 
She was silent for a while , then said , `` Why are you so unhappy '' ? ? 
`` I'm not unhappy '' , I lied , staring at the snow . 
She was trying to make a hole in my armor , and I didn't want it . 
`` Is it a woman '' ? ? 
She asked gently . 
She must have seen the ring on my left hand . 
`` Well -- women and unhappiness go together '' , I observed profoundly , adding , `` You can wager your derriere on that '' . 
`` Ah , Monsieur , it is not my business to wager it . 
'' 
This took me so funny I had to look at her . 
I felt my frozen sad face crumble , and I grinned a silly one I couldn't have helped . 
I even snorted a chuckle . 
She smiled at me , but it was an awfully sad smile . 
She was even more miserable than me . 
Her eyes were smiling , too , but so sadly , and there was tiredness and infinite wisdom in them . 
`` Now isn't it better to smile '' ? ? 
She asked . 
Because I liked this sad person so much , I said , `` Will you have a drink with me '' ? ? 
I could see the ancient cynicism reinforce itself in her eyes , and I wondered how many men she had picked up with this same gambit . 
Anyway , I pulled a bottle of Remy Martin out of my topcoat , drew the cork , and passed it to her . 
I could see she was shocked . 
`` I'm sorry I haven't got a glass '' , I said . 
`` Non , non '' , she said , taking the bottle , `` not for that be sorry '' . 
She tilted up and drank , and then I drank . 
It's really rotten to drink good cognac like that , but I hadn't cared before . 
I wasn't going to lug around a glass . 
There wasn't much light in the blue dark , but I could see her well . 
No child , this tart , she must have been thirty-five or even forty . 
I couldn't be sure . 
Somehow she was attractive . 
Not good looking , but self-confident and wise so that it made her attractive . 
I liked her , and all at once I was glad she was there . 
We finished the bottle -- I hadn't had a lot out of it earlier -- not speaking much to each other , and we stayed sober . 
I suppose we were cold , but we didn't feel it . 
We seemed to be drowsing , sadly , soberly , in the cold , cold air while the snow fell . 
Then she said , `` Allons '' , and we got up and went to my hotel without another word . 
I sensed no stranger in her . 
We undressed and made love with the comfortable acceptance I had once known with Valery . 
I decided thirty-five was the best estimate of her age . 
She had a funny little scar on her stomach , on the left side . 
I think we were very tired , for we awoke at the same moment , deeply rested , surprised to see the late morning sun on the windows , which were wet where the rime had melted . 
I felt wonderful , the absolute opposite of last night's melancholy . 
My head was clear . 
I was hungry as a wolf , and my body felt lean and vital . 
`` Bon jour '' , I said brightly , sitting up , which pulled the covers to her hips . 
She looked good , with her short tousled hair and no make-up . 
Maybe closer to thirty , I thought . 
`` Bon jour '' ! ! 
She exclaimed , smiling . 
`` J'ai faim '' ! ! 
`` Yeah , but breakfast first '' . 
With a laugh she beat me to the bathroom . 
I called downstairs for food and a toothbrush for her . 
She came out pink from a hot bath , and I gave her my robe . 
I had brushed my teeth , showered , shaved and dressed by the time a waiter wheeled in breakfast . 
`` The toothbrush Monsieur '' , he said , presenting it . 
I gave it to the woman . 
`` What is this for '' ? ? 
She asked innocently . 
`` Why , to brush your teeth '' . 
`` But I already have ! ! 
I used yours '' . 
`` Oh '' ? ? 
I said with round eyes . 
I wondered if I ought to go use the new one myself . 
But I smelled the coffee , and thinking , What the hell , live dangerously , I decided I would scald my worries away . 
The coffee wasn't very hot though , made in a filter pot , but it was good . 
We sent the waiter away and ate a tremendous amount of cold ham , hot hard-boiled eggs and hot garlic bread . 
As we ate , we talked . 
Her name was Suzanne , and mine Stephen . 
We sat back comfortably on the bed with our last cups of coffee . 
`` You are very tactful , do you know , Stephen '' , she remarked . 
`` Um '' ? ? 
I grunted , sipping . 
`` Yes , because you didn't run off to use that new toothbrush '' . 
I raised my eyes to look at her in the mirror . 
`` I didn't really use yours '' , she went on . 
`` I carry one in my purse . 
I know men never kiss les putains '' . 
To my immense relief , she changed the subject in the next sentence : `` Shall we go to the Louvre today '' ? ? 
`` All right '' . 
I said with enthusiasm at the idea . 
`` But not immediately '' . 
I put aside my empty cup . 
She smiled all the way to her wise , sad eyes , and drained her own . 
We were not rushed . 
`` What is this from '' ? ? 
I asked , touching the scar on her stomach . 
It was like a long thin line drawn through a pink circle . 
`` A bullet '' , she answered . 
The cynicism was back in her eyes , a bitter wisdom , and I wondered if forty were not so far wrong after all . 
She understood sex anyway , and played at it well . 
We went to the Louvre for a few hours , then by Metro to a cabaret in Montmartre . 
It was a nice place , not filled with smoke . 
We had champagne and steamed mussels . 
The sommelier brought the wine first , a magnum instead of the bottle I had ordered . 
He must have thought I was a tourist . 
I fixed him with a steely eye and said , `` What's this for ? ? 
I didn't ask for a Jeroboam of champagne '' . 
I thought that was pretty humorous , but I didn't laugh . 
Two letters had arrived for Miss Theresa Stubblefield : she put them in her bag . 
She would not stop to read them in American Express , as many were doing , sitting on benches or leaning against the walls , but pushed her way out into the street . 
This was her first day in Rome and it was June . 
An enormous sky of the most delicate blue arched overhead . 
In her mind's eye -- her imagination responding fully , almost exhaustingly , to these shores' peculiar powers of stimulation -- she saw the city as from above , telescoped on its great bare plains that the ruins marked , aqueducts and tombs , here a cypress , there a pine , and all around the low blue hills . 
Pictures in old Latin books returned to her : the Appian Way Today , the Colosseum , the Arch of Constantine . 
She would see them , looking just as they had in the books , and this would make up a part of her delight . 
Moreover , nursing various Stubblefields -- her aunt , then her mother , then her father -- through their lengthy illnesses ( everybody could tell you the Stubblefields were always sick ) , Theresa had had a chance to read quite a lot . 
England , France , Germany , Switzerland , and Italy had all been rendered for her time and again , and between the prescribed hours of pills and tonics , she had conceived a dreamy passion by lamplight , to see all these places with her own eyes . 
The very night after her father's funeral she had thought , though never admitted to a soul : Now I can go . 
There's nothing to stop me now . 
So here it was , here was Italy , anyway , and terribly noisy . 
In the street the traffic was really frightening . 
Cars , taxis , buses , and motorscooters all went plunging at once down the narrow length of it or swerving perilously around a fountain . 
Shoals of tourists went by her in national groups -- English school girls in blue uniforms , German boys with cameras attached , smartly dressed Americans looking in shop windows . 
Glad to be alone , Theresa climbed the splendid outdoor staircase that opened to her left . 
The Spanish Steps . 
Something special was going on here just now -- the annual display of azalea plants . 
She had heard about it the night before at her hotel . 
It was not yet complete : workmen were unloading the potted plants from a truck and placing them in banked rows on the steps above . 
The azaleas were as large as shrubs , and their myriad blooms , many still tight in the bud , ranged in color from purple through fuchsia and rose to the palest pink , along with many white ones too . 
Marvelous , thought Theresa , climbing in her portly , well-bred way , for she was someone who had learned that if you only move slowly enough you have time to notice everything . 
In Rome , all over Europe , she intended to move very slowly indeed . 
Halfway up the staircase she stopped and sat down . 
Other people were doing it , too , sitting all along the wide banisters and leaning over the parapets above , watching the azaleas mass , or just enjoying the sun . 
Theresa sat with her letters in her lap , breathing Mediterranean air . 
The sun warmed her , as it seemed to be warming everything , perhaps even the underside of stones or the chill insides of churches . 
She loosened her tweed jacket and smoked a cigarette . 
Content excited ; ; 
how could you be both at once ? ? 
Strange , but she was . 
Presently , she picked up the first of the letters . 
A few moments later her hands were trembling and her brow had contracted with anxiety and dismay . 
Of course , one of them would have to go and do this ! ! 
Poor Cousin Elec , she thought , tears rising to sting in the sun , but why couldn't he have arranged to live through the summer ? ? 
And how on earth did I ever get this letter anyway ? ? 
She had reason indeed to wonder how the letter had managed to find her . 
Her Cousin Emma Carraway had written it , in her loose high old lady's script -- t's carefully crossed , but l's inclined to wobble like an old car on the downward slope . 
Cousin Emma had simply put Miss Theresa Stubblefield , Rome , Italy , on the envelope , had walked up to the post office in Tuxapoka , Alabama , and mailed it with as much confidence as if it had been a birthday card to her next-door neighbor . 
No return address whatsoever . 
Somebody had scrawled American Express , Piazza di Spagna ? ? 
, across the envelope , and now Theresa had it , all as easily as if she had been the President of the Republic or the Pope . 
Inside were all the things they thought she ought to know concerning the last illness , death , and burial of Cousin Alexander Carraway . 
Cousin Emma and Cousin Elec , brother and sister -- unmarried , devoted , aging -- had lived next door to the Stubblefields in Tuxapoka from time immemorial until the Stubblefields had moved to Montgomery fifteen years ago . 
Two days before he was taken sick , Cousin Elec was out worrying about what too much rain might do to his sweetpeas , and Cousin Elec had always preserved in the top drawer of his secretary a mother-of-pearl paper knife which Theresa had coveted as a child and which he had promised she could have when he died . 
I'm supposed to care as much now as then , as much here as there , she realized , with a sigh . 
This letter would have got to me if she hadn't even put Rome , Italy , on it . 
She refolded the letter , replaced it in its envelope , and turned with relief to one from her brother George . 
But alas George , when he had written , had only just returned from going to Tuxapoka to Cousin Elec's funeral . 
He was full of heavy family reminiscence . 
All the fine old stock was dying out , look at the world today . 
His own children had suffered from the weakening of those values which he and Theresa had always taken for granted , and as for his grandchildren ( he had one so far , still in diapers ) , he shuddered to think that the true meaning of character might never dawn on them at all . 
A life of gentility and principle such as Cousin Elec had lived had to be known at first hand . 
Poor George ! ! 
The only boy , the family darling . 
Together with her mother , both of them tense with worry lest things should somehow go wrong . 
Theresa had seen him through the right college , into the right fraternity , and though pursued by various girls and various mammas of girls , safely married to the right sort , however much in the early years of that match his wife , Anne , had not seemed to understand poor George . 
Could it just be , Theresa wondered , that Anne had understood only too well , and that George all along was extraordinary only in the degree to which he was dull ? ? 
As for Cousin Alexander Carraway , the only thing Theresa could remember at the moment about him ( except his paper knife ) was that he had had exceptionally long hands and feet and one night about one o'clock in the morning the whole Stubblefield family had been aroused to go next door at Cousin Emma's call -- first Papa , then Mother , then Theresa and George . 
There they all did their uttermost to help Cousin Elec get a cramp out of his foot . 
He had hobbled downstairs into the parlor , in his agony , and was sitting , wrapped in his bathrobe , on a footstool . 
He held his long clenched foot in both hands , and this and his contorted face -- he was trying heroically not to cry out -- made him look like a large skinny old monkey . 
They all surrounded him , the family circle , Theresa and George as solemn as if they were watching the cat have kittens , and Cousin Emma running back and forth with a kettle of hot water which she poured steaming into a white enamelled pan . 
`` Can you think of anything to do '' ? ? 
She kept repeating . 
`` I hate to call the doctor but if this keeps up I'll just have to ! ! 
Can you think of anything to do '' ? ? 
`` You might treat it like the hiccups '' , said Papa . 
`` Drop a cold key down his back '' . 
`` I just hope this happens to you someday '' , said Cousin Elec , who was not at his best . 
`` Poor Cousin Elec '' , George said . 
He was younger than Theresa : she remembered looking down and seeing his great round eyes , while at the same time she was dimly aware that her mother and father were not unamused . 
`` Poor Cousin Elec '' . 
Now , here they both were , still the same , George full of round-eyed woe , and Cousin Emma in despair . 
Theresa shifted to a new page . 
`` Of course ( George's letter continued ) , there are practical problems to be considered . 
Cousin Emma is alone in that big old house and won't hear to parting from it . 
Robbie and Beryl tried their best to persuade her to come and stay with them , and Anne and I have told her she's more than welcome here , but I think she feels that she might be an imposition , especially as long as our Rosie is still in high school . 
The other possibility is to make arrangements for her to let out one or two of the rooms to some teacher of good family or one of those solitary old ladies that Tuxapoka is populated with -- Miss Edna Whittaker , for example . 
But there is more in this than meets the eye . 
A new bathroom would certainly have to be put in . 
The wallpaper in the back bedroom is literally crumbling off . 
'' ( Theresa skipped a page of details about the house . 
) `` I hope if you have any ideas along these lines you will write me about them . 
I may settle on some makeshift arrangements for the summer and wait until you return in the fall so we can work out together the best . 
'' 
I really shouldn't have smoked a cigarette so early in the day , thought Theresa , it always makes me sick . 
I'll start sneezing in a minute , sitting on these cold steps . 
She got up , standing uncertainly for a moment , then moving aside to let go past her , talking , a group of young men . 
They wore shoes with pointed toes , odd to American eyes , and narrow trousers , and their hair looked unnaturally black and slick . 
Yet here they were obviously thought to be handsome , and felt themselves to be so . 
Just then a man approached her with a tray of cheap cameos , Parker fountain pens , rosaries , papal portraits . 
`` No '' , said Theresa . 
`` No , no '' ! ! 
She said . 
The man did not wish to leave . 
He knew how to spread himself against the borders of the space that had to separate them . 
Carrozza rides in the park , the Colosseum by moonlight , he specialized . 
Theresa turned away to escape , and climbed to a higher landing where the steps divided in two . 
There she walked to the far left and leaned on a vacant section of banister , while the vendor picked himself another well-dressed American lady , carrying a camera and a handsome alligator bag , ascending the steps alone . 
Was he ever successful , Theresa wondered . 
The lady with the alligator bag registered interest , doubt , then indignation ; ; 
at last , alarm . 
She cast about as though looking for a policeman : this really shouldn't be allowed ! ! 
Finally , she scurried away up the steps . 
Theresa Stubblefield , still holding the family letters in one hand , realized that her whole trip to Europe was viewed in family circles as an interlude between Cousin Elec's death and `` doing something '' about Cousin Emma . 
They were even , Anne and George , probably thinking themselves very considerate in not hinting that she really should cut out `` one or two countries '' and come home in August to get Cousin Emma's house ready before the teachers came to Tuxapoka in September . 
Of course , it wasn't Anne and George's fault that one family crisis seemed to follow another , and weren't they always emphasizing that they really didn't know what they would do without Theresa ? ? 
The trouble is , Theresa thought , that while everything that happens there is supposed to matter supremely , nothing here is supposed even to exist . 
They would not care if all of Europe were to sink into the ocean tomorrow . 
It never registered with them that I had time to read all of Balzac , Dickens , and Stendhal while Papa was dying , not to mention everything in the city library after Mother's operation . 
It would have been exactly the same to them if I had read through all twenty-six volumes of Elsie Dinsmore . 
She arranged the letters carefully , one on top of the other . 
Then , with a motion so suddenly violent that she amazed herself , she tore them in two . 
`` Signora '' ? ? 
She became aware that two Italian workmen , carrying a large azalea pot , were standing before her and wanted her to move so that they could begin arranging a new row of the display . 
`` Mi diapiace , Signora , ma insomma . 
'' 
`` Oh put it there '' ! ! 
She indicated a spot a little distance away . 
I knew it as surely as everybody in Westfield -- that Lucille was a husband stealer . 
You can't keep that kind of information quiet in a town of only 4000-plus . 
And I've been told that just about every town , no matter what its size , has its Lucille Warren . 
Just as it has its Susan Dolan , though nobody'd ever bothered to tell me that . 
Susan Dolan , that's me . 
They even talked about Lucille down at the Young Christians' League where I spent a lot of time in Bible classes and helping out with the office work for our foreign mission . 
I never heard my folks talk about her , though . 
They were good-living religious people , and I can truthfully say I never heard them spread any gossip about anybody . 
Even if they ever did say anything about people like Lucille Warren , I know they wouldn't have dreamed of saying it in front of me . 
My folks and my faith protected me from things like that . 
And so I was really upset the first time I discovered that my boy friend Johnnie was seeing Mrs. Warren . 
I asked him about it one night while we were sitting in his truck . 
I asked him if it was true . 
He gave me a straight , honest answer . 
`` Look , Sue baby '' , he'd said . 
Much as I love you -- well , a guy's a guy and Lucille's willing to -- to come across . 
Honest , kitten , that's all it is -- I don't even like Lucille much '' . 
I guess it was at that moment that I realized what I was up against in the person of Lucille Warren . 
But it didn't seem fair . 
My love for Johnnie was young and clean -- how could I possibly compete with a woman like that , who didn't hesitate to use her sex . 
Johnnie was a trucker with a small lumber outfit in a town about twenty miles away , and he was also pretty good at anything in the carpentry line . 
It was a vivid , sharp February morning that Johnnie first made his appearance in my back yard , bringing some stuff Dad had ordered . 
I wasn't in the habit of batting my eyes at delivery men , but the moment I saw Johnnie , I knew he was different . 
He wasn't only different -- he was it . 
He had an easy masculine grace about him , the kind that kids don't have , but that I had sometimes admired in other older men . 
His smile was quick , and his eyes held some promised secret that made my knees go limp . 
The most unbelievable thing about the chance meeting was that he seemed interested in me , too . 
I could hardly believe such good luck was mine . 
And now Lucille Warren had gotten a look at him . 
I guess she was between affairs or something , but anyway , she had set her sights on Johnnie , my Johnnie . 
I didn't like it one bit . 
But what could I do ? ? 
A man had to have his release -- at least that's what the boys used to say in high school -- and I wasn't providing it for Johnnie . 
Neither was his wife . 
She wouldn't have , even if he'd asked her . 
But he wouldn't ask her -- he wasn't the kind of man who would force his wife to submit to him against her will . 
And he wouldn't leave her either -- he'd told me that . 
He was too honorable to leave his wife penniless and leave those helpless children without their daddy . 
Johnnie loved me and wanted me . 
But the only love I was giving him was the pure kind . 
It was weeks before we even kissed for the first time . 
Against my folks' wishes , we'd been seeing each other for short rides in the truck . 
The rides were tame enough -- mostly we talked . 
But by the time the first crackling of spring came around , we both knew we were hopelessly in love . 
Yet even then we did nothing much but talk , and maybe neck a little . 
`` It's so crazy '' , I told him once . 
`` I always imagined I would probably end up marrying a minister or somebody like that . 
Somebody with no vices . 
You know '' . 
`` And you fall for a lumber jockey '' . 
`` Who drinks far too much '' . 
`` And smokes too much '' . 
`` And '' , I was ticking off the items on my fingers , `` swears too much and goes out with the boys , whoever they are , too much , and who ever goes to church and won't even listen when I try to persuade him to come back to the fold '' . 
He examined his nails carefully . 
`` I could walk out the door '' . 
`` Don't you dare '' . 
`` And never show my face or my truck around here again '' . 
He still wasn't looking at me . 
`` You wouldn't '' . 
`` Or I could visit Lucille Warren '' . 
`` You wouldn't . 
Please ! ! 
You wouldn't '' . 
He shrugged noncommittally . 
`` I might '' . 
And now he was seeing her . 
He'd just admitted it to me . 
I huddled miserably beside him in the truck . 
It was all my doing -- his seeing her . 
Johnnie and I had been innocent in our love , and that was the way I wanted to keep it . 
At first , Johnnie hadn't understood -- how could he , not being a religious person like me ? ? 
But then he had said , `` All right , kid , if that's how you want it , that's how it'll be '' . 
But what had I done , trying to keep us pure ? ? 
I had driven him into the arms of that scheming woman . 
I had just the same as delivered him into the hands of the Devil ! ! 
So one week later , I surrendered to him in the little motel on Route 10 . 
My very first time . 
I was desperate to hold him , to give him whatever in this world he wanted or needed , and to keep him from the clutches of Lucille Warren . 
And , though at the time I blushed to admit it even to myself , there was in me a growing desire , a sexual awareness , that Johnnie had set in motion , an awareness that no other man had ever triggered . 
I wanted him , with a terrifying fierceness . 
Astonishingly enough , it was my own voice I heard there in the darkness , begging this man to make love to me . 
`` Love me , Johnnie '' . 
`` I will , kitten '' ! ! 
Outside , in the summertime fields behind the motel , a thousand crickets serenaded us . 
`` Will you always love me this way '' ? ? 
`` Uh huh . 
Always '' . 
`` Mmm '' . 
And I snuggled closer to the man I loved . 
It was as blissful and fulfilling a night as any bride ever experienced . 
I had had no wedding ceremony , no witnesses , no certificate of marriage , but I had all the joy that goes with them . 
`` Johnnie ? ? 
`` It can't be wrong , can it ? ? 
Not really '' . 
Johnnie rose on one elbow . 
`` Stop worrying . 
It's never wrong if love is real '' . 
I took great comfort from his words , and smiled to myself in the darkness . 
Infinite peace , complete contentment . 
Idiot's delight , I later discovered . 
I felt no conflict between what I was doing and my strict religious upbringing . 
I had always resisted the passes made at me by other kids , and many times I had thought about my love for Johnnie who , being thirty , brought a maturity to love that the kids around town could know nothing about . 
I had also thought a lot about how God must look on true love , and so in a way I was keeping my promise to God , my promise to remain pure until I was married . 
I was practically a bride , after all . 
There would have been a ceremony if it had been possible . 
Of this , I had no doubt . 
Wouldn't Johnnie do practically anything in the world to insure my happiness ? ? 
Of course he would . 
He'd not only told me so , he'd proved it . 
It wasn't Johnnie's fault that he was hopelessly tied down to that frightful woman who did her best to make his life unbearable . 
Just because he was honorable enough to want to continue supporting his two children , as any decent man would , that was no reason he should be denied his own small share of happiness too . 
And if I could contribute to that , I'd do it . 
The cost didn't matter . 
No price is too high when true love is at stake . 
And I had no doubts about how true this love was . 
I'd never even petted with a boy , and after I met Johnnie he never touched me for the longest while , not until I all but threw myself at him . 
He was plenty attentive , all right , but he behaved like a gentleman , and I figured that , emotionally , I was closer to his age than to my own eighteen and a half . 
What could a mere twelve years matter ? ? 
It wasn't , I was sure , a difference in age that came between people , but a difference in maturity . 
And hadn't I rescued him from Lucille Warren ? ? 
She'd have gotten him , if I hadn't stopped her . 
After all , Lucille Warren was a husband-stealer from way back . 
But I'd been a good girl and now God was blessing me with the gift of this magnificent man and the wondrous love we shared . 
It was only fitting that we seek out whatever joy our union might bring . 
`` Love me '' ? ? 
`` Uh-huh . 
Love you '' . 
`` Always and always , Johnnie '' ? ? 
`` Always '' . 
`` Mmm '' . 
Convention time in Boston . 
A chill wind in the air and the narrow streets packed with snow . 
From the entire eastern half of the nation they'd be coming , members of the Young Christians' League , and I'd been chosen to represent our chapter . 
I had mixed emotions about going . 
I'd been seeing Johnnie almost a year now , but I still didn't want to leave him for five whole days . 
But I had looked forward so much to being with this church group . 
I hadn't been doing as much work as I used to in Westfield and I felt funny about that and wanted to work harder than ever . 
I wanted to just throw myself into the good works of this fine group . 
So I went to Boston . 
The first meeting was held in Faneuil Hall , a great big place where we were able to meet members from all the other states . 
My cousin Alma , at whose home I was staying during the convention , introduced me to a group of young people from Rhode Island . 
One of them was a very friendly , lovely fellow named Ronald , a boy about my age with slick , blond hair and dancing blue eyes . 
He looked very different from Johnnie -- in fact , he looked sort of like me . 
I thought so , and he mentioned it , and Alma said so too . 
After the meeting , there was going to be a party at someone's house . 
I assumed Alma would get me there , but in the confusion of the meeting breaking up , we were separated . 
Outside the hall , I anxiously looked around for her , then all at once there was a hand on my elbow . 
`` Hey , there , beautiful twin of mine '' , Ronald said . 
`` Need a pumpkin to get to the party '' ? ? 
I couldn't help laughing with him . 
`` Well , I should find Alma '' -- I began . 
`` Alma , Schmalma . 
Come along with me '' . 
I went . 
By the time we arrived , the party was already going strong . 
A couple of the girls were laughing rather shrilly and I realized they were drinking . 
My folks wouldn't dream of having alcohol in the house , so my first taste of it had been -- of course -- with Johnnie . 
I hadn't liked it at first -- it was bitter and burning . 
But when Johnnie disguised the taste with ginger ale , I enjoyed it . 
Of course I enjoyed 'most anything if I did it with Johnnie . 
Johnnie I suddenly realized he'd been totally out of my thoughts all evening . 
But that was only natural , I decided ; ; 
surely he was still resting snugly in my heart . 
`` I don't see Alma anywhere '' , I said . 
`` She's invisible tonight . 
C'mon , let's find out where they're keeping the glasses '' . 
I drew back . 
`` I -- I don't think so , Ronald . 
Not for me '' . 
`` Aw , come on '' . 
`` No -- really '' . 
He shrugged . 
`` Okay . 
But at least come along while I get lubricated '' . 
The kitchen was jammed . 
Strange faces , most of them , and I wasn't even sure all of them had come from the League meeting . 
Under normal circumstances , he had a certain bright-eyed all-American-boy charm , with great appeal for young ladies , old ladies , and dogs . 
Today , he looked like an Astronaut who had left his vitamin pills on the bureau and spent six months in space : hollow eyes , hollow cheeks , hollow stomach . 
Breakfast , he thought . 
A shot of orange juice would make everything seem better . 
He looked around his little Eden : bureau , bed , table , chair , two-burner stove . 
Then he remembered . 
`` You share a refrigerator '' , Mrs. Kirby had said , and somehow , at midnight , after the long drive from New York in pelting rain , that had sounded reasonable . 
In the cold light of day , it seemed a lunatic arrangement . 
Share bath , maybe -- but share refrigerator ? ? 
She had explained it -- something about summer people's eating out and not enough space in the units . 
And where was the thing ? ? 
He remembered seeing it last night , when he put away his small store of bachelor-type eatables . 
Ah , yes -- his half of a refrigerator stood outside , on the `` curving veranda '' between Unit Number Three and Unit Number Four . 
It was still raining , and Mrs. Kirby's cottages bloomed through the gray haze like the names they bore , vivid blue and green and magenta . 
Charlie downed his orange juice and one of the long , skinny green pills , his spirits as damp as the day . 
This vacation had seemed like a good idea last week , when his doctor had prescribed it . 
`` Take a full month '' , the doctor had said . 
`` Lots of sun , lots of rest . 
The red pills are a vitamin-and-iron compound . 
This is a sleeping capsule . 
The others will make you a little more comfortable until you get it licked . 
You young men get to be my age , you won't take flu so lightly '' . 
Charlie had accepted the diagnosis without comment . 
The doctor could call it anything from flu to beriberi ; ; 
but Charlie knew what was wrong with him and knew , too , that there was no pill to cure it . 
He had loved and lost Vivian Wayne to somebody else , had watched her marry the somebody else , and had caught a bear of a cold by kissing the bride good-by forever , which was really piling it on . 
He had caught , too , like an ailment , a confirmed distrust of women . 
Once burned -- scalded , really , because Vivian had given him every encouragement -- forever shy . 
From now on , his was going to be a man's world : the North Woods , duck blinds at dawning , beer and poker and male secretaries . 
Meanwhile , he had this miserable cold , and as he leaned against the refrigerator , watching the rain make sandy puddles at his feet , the doctor's prescription for lots of sun seemed like a hollow mockery . 
In these damp circumstances , he was an odds-on bet to develop pneumonia . 
He looked up to see Mrs. Kirby , awesome in a black-and-yellow polka-dotted slicker , bearing down on him . 
`` Three-day blow '' ! ! 
She bellowed triumphantly . 
He had noticed before that the natives seemed to regard really filthy weather as a kind of Pyhrric victory over the tourists . 
`` Fine , day after tomorrow '' , she added . 
`` I hope so '' , he said . 
`` I've got this cold . 
Thought I'd bake it out in the sun '' . 
`` Ah '' . 
She studied him briefly . 
`` You've got a peaked look . 
Better get in out of the wet '' . 
Charlie forbore to mention that the wet was somewhat universal , Peony being less than weatherproof . 
As for its being fine , day after tomorrow , he had the unhappy conviction that it would never be fine again , with Vivian lost to him forever . 
He could imagine her at this minute , honeymooning in Nassau with what's-his-name , lounging on golden sands , looking forward to a life of unalloyed bliss . 
All Charlie could look forward to was a yellow pill at noon , a salami sandwich for lunch , and a lonely old age -- if he lived that long . 
He leafed through the light reading provided by Mrs. Kirby for her guests : four separate adventures of the Bobbsey Twins ( At the Seashore , At the Mountains , On the Farm , and In Danger ) and several agricultural bulletins on the treatment of hoof-and-mouth disease in cattle , hideously illustrated . 
He dozed , only to dream of Vivian , and woke , only to crash into the night table , bruising his other shin . 
He took a yellow pill , only to choke on it , and went for the salami , only to find something alive in the refrigerator -- something pink and fuzzy . 
His first thought was that Mrs. Kirby , in her mania for color , had dyed a cat and that cat had somehow managed to open the refrigerator door and climb in ; ; 
but on further investigation , the thing proved to be a sweater , of the long-hair variety that sheds onto men's jackets -- pale , pale pink and , according to the label , size thirty-four . 
He thought about it for a minute , could find no reasonable explanation for the presence of a sweater in the refrigerator , got the salami , bread , and a Bermuda onion , and put the whole thing out of his mind . 
Next morning , he found a note in the refrigerator . 
`` Would you mind wrapping your onion '' ? ? 
Said this note . 
`` The smell permeates everything '' ! ! 
Everything being the sweater , a lipstick case , and a squirt bottle of Kissin' Kare pink hand lotion . 
The note paper was pink , too , and the handwriting small and dainty and utterly feminine . 
Not that he had supposed , considering the evidence , that he was sharing this refrigerator with a member of the Beach Patrol . 
He scrawled `` Sorry '' across the bottom of the note and then , against his better judgment , added : `` Don't you eat '' ? ? 
He didn't want to encourage anything here ; ; 
but on the other hand , he didn't want her swiping his salami . 
`` Not onions '' , came the answer the following day . 
`` Ugh '' . 
Must have really smelled up her sweater , he thought , and wondered idly just why she kept the sweater fast-frozen . 
But then , as he well knew , women are not guided by logic or common sense . 
Take Vivian . 
Yes , take Vivian . 
Somebody had . 
Now , if this were Vivian next door to him and if , for some obscure female reason , she kept her clothes in the refrigerator , they would not be pink . 
They would be black or white or horse-blanket plaid , chic and splashy , like Vivian herself . 
Pink , Vivian once had told him , was for baby girls , and grown-up girls who wore pink were subconsciously clinging to their infancy . 
`` Why does this girl keep a sweater in the refrigerator '' ? ? 
He mused aloud . 
Eh '' ? ? 
It was Mrs. Kirby , making her toilsome way along the veranda , laden with a clattery collection of mops , brushes , and pails . 
`` What's that you say '' ? ? 
`` Oh , nothing . 
Just glad the rain's stopped '' . 
`` Oh , yes . 
Just look at that sky . 
Be a scorcher by afternoon '' . 
`` I hope so . 
I've got this cold '' . 
`` So you said '' . 
She scrutinized him . 
`` My , you're peaked . 
You want to watch out that you don't get burned to an ash , first sunny day . 
I must remember to warn the girl next to you in Larkspur . 
That pale kind's the worst '' . 
That pale kind , Charlie thought . 
Hardly an inviting description . 
But then , neither was peaked . 
He could hear Mrs. Kirby now , warning her pale guest against sunburn . 
`` I spoke to the fellow next door , too '' , she might say . 
`` He's that peaked kind '' . 
Surely there was a better word . 
Charlie looked in the mirror . 
Run-down , iron-poor . 
He looked more closely . 
Frail , feeble -- peaked . 
Clearly , two damp days with the Bobbsey Twins had done him no good . 
The sun , blazing hot as prophesied , was far from kind to Mrs. Kirby's varicolored properties . 
When Charlie came up from the beach for his four-o'clock pill , the whole establishment ( gaudy enough when seen through mist and fog ) looked like a floodlit modern painting -- great blocks of dizzy color , punctuated at regular intervals by the glaring white of five community refrigerators . 
This weekend , he thought , he would look around for some more subdued retreat , with Cape roses , maybe , at the door . 
He could not imagine a flower's being brave enough to grow beside Peony , Larkspur , and the rest . 
The sweater was gone from the refrigerator , and in its place was a large plastic bag , full of wet pink clothes . 
No wonder she was so pale , wearing all those cold clothes . 
He got a red pill and a beer and then , on impulse , transferred the rest of his salami to her side of the refrigerator and scrawled `` Be my guest '' on the wrapping . 
It gave him a good feeling . 
`` M-m-m . 
Thanks '' , was her answer the next day . 
The note was propped against his pill bottles and bore a postscript : `` You're not at all well , are you '' ? ? 
`` I've got this cold '' , he wrote . 
Not that it was any of her business . 
`` It's none of my business '' , said the next note , `` but my Aunt Elsie used to take lemon juice and honey in hot water for a cold , and she lived to be ninety-six . 
I mean , she's still living , and she's ninety-six . 
Why don't you try that '' ? ? 
`` I don't have a lemon '' . 
He had to write very small to get it on the bottom of the scrap of paper . 
By the next morning , she had turned the paper over . 
`` Gee , neither do I '' . 
Charlie grinned . 
She didn't sound like a pale girl . 
She sounded a little like a redhead . 
But then , redheads are often pale . 
He stuck his head in Mrs. Kirby's little rental office . 
`` I guess that redhead next to me took your advice . 
I haven't seen her on the beach '' . 
`` You won't , if you're looking for a redhead . 
She's got browny hair '' . 
He spent that afternoon on the beach , looking for a pale , browny-haired girl in a pink bathing suit . 
There were pink bathing suits on blondes , and browny-haired girls in red or black or green bathing suits . 
There were a sprinkling of daring bikinis and a preponderance of glorified tank suits . 
Up on a dune , he saw a girl , all by herself , sitting on a camp stool before an easel and absorbed in her painting . 
He paid little attention to her because she was a redhead and because she was wearing white -- one of those bulky , turtle-neck sweaters . 
On the beach , there were pale girls and not-so-pale girls . 
And he saw them all as he walked up and down . 
At two that morning , he was still walking -- up and down Peony , up and down the veranda , up and down the silent , moonlit beach . 
Finally , in desperation , he opened the refrigerator , filched her hand lotion , and left a note . 
`` I've got this sunburn '' , said the note , `` and I used some of your hand lotion . 
Hope you don't mind '' . 
`` Of course I don't mind '' , she answered . 
`` You're having a miserable time , aren't you ? ? 
Use all the lotion you want , and for goodness' sake , stay in out of the sun for a couple of days '' . 
This was a very warm , sympathetic girl , he decided . 
Sympathy is a fine quality in a woman . 
Now Vivian , for instance , was not too long on sympathy . 
She felt , and said , that sympathy only made people feel sorry for themselves ; ; 
it was a tough world , and you had to be tough to hold your own . 
He didn't know what was so tough about Vivian's world , slopping around Nassau with what's-his-name . 
Suppose what's-his-name got a sunburn ? ? 
Charlie couldn't see Vivian offering any hand lotion . 
She might peel him , once the worst of the agony was over . 
Charlie spent the next two days in his pajama bottoms , waiting for the fire in his back to subside , and used generous quantities of the hand lotion . 
Correspondence passed back and forth . 
`` How's your sunburn now ? ? 
The only thing , this lotion has glycerin in it , and that whitens the skin , so if you're so anxious to get a tan , you may not want to use it '' . 
`` I'm not that anxious , but maybe that's why you're so fair '' . 
`` That Mrs. Kirby ! ! 
I'll bet she told you I was puny , too . 
How's your cold '' ? ? 
`` Broiled out . 
She didn't say you were puny . 
Are you ? ? 
What's puny '' ? ? 
`` Puny goes with pale and peaked . 
Do you have anything to read while you're shut up ? ? 
There are two things here about Surviving in the Wilderness , and a book called ' Tom Swift and His Speedy Canoe ' ; ; 
but the picture of Tom Swift is pretty sinister . 
Also the canoe '' . 
There was a crowd in the stands for a change and the sun was hot . 
The new Riverside pitcher turned out to have an overhand fast ball that took a hop . 
For a few innings the Anniston team couldn't figure him out . 
Then , in the fifth , Anniston's kid catcher caught onto a curve and smacked the ball into left center field . 
Eddie Lee , Riverside's redheaded playing manager , ran after the ball but it rolled past him . 
Phil Rossoff cut over to center from left field to get the relay . 
Eddie caught up with the ball near the fence and threw it to Phil . 
`` Third ! ! 
Third base '' ! ! 
Eddie shouted . 
Phil spun around and made an accurate throw into Mike Deegan's hands on third base . 
Mike caught the ball just as the catcher slid into the bag . 
But the Anniston boy had begun his slide too late . 
He came into the bag with his body and Mike Deegan brought the ball down full in his face . 
`` You bastard '' ! ! 
The Anniston catcher screamed . 
He jumped to his feet and started to throw punches . 
Mike Deegan tossed his glove away and began to swing at the catcher . 
This brought in everybody from both sides , while the spectators stood up and added to the uproar . 
The fighters were separated in a few minutes . 
The game was resumed . 
But Mike Deegan was boiling mad now . 
When the inning was over he cursed the Anniston catcher all the way into the dugout . 
Phil Rossoff , coming in from left field , stopped at the water fountain for a drink . 
Mike Deegan was standing beside it , facing the field . 
He was eyeing the Anniston catcher warming up his pitcher before the inning began . 
`` Keep your eyes open , sonny '' ! ! 
Mike yelled to the catcher . 
`` You're in for trouble '' . 
The Anniston catcher did not reply with words . 
He simply turned to Mike and smiled . 
This so infuriated Deegan that he spun around and said : `` I'll get that little bastard . 
So help me God , I'll get him '' . 
Phil Rossoff said : `` Why don't you leave him alone '' ? ? 
`` Mind your own goddamn business '' , Mike Deegan said . 
Phil shrugged . 
He stepped into the dugout , wondering why Deegan was always looking for trouble . 
Maybe the answer was in his eyes . 
When Deegan smiled his eyes never fit in with his lips . 
In the last of the sixth inning Mike Deegan got up to bat and hit a fast ball over the left fielder's head . 
By the time the fielder got his hands on the ball Deegan was rounding third base and heading for home . 
The left fielder threw and it was a good one . 
But Mike had no chance of being tagged . 
The Anniston catcher was straddling home plate . 
All Deegan had to do was slide , fall away , but instead , he rammed into the catcher . 
Both fell heavily to the ground . 
Only Mike got to his feet . 
He went back to touch home plate , turned and walked to the dugout without looking back . 
The Anniston players and their manager ran out on the field . 
They poured water over their catcher's face . 
He did not move . 
Then the manager called for a doctor . 
The Riverside physician came down to look over the injured ballplayer . 
Then , quickly , and a little nervously , the doctor ordered a couple of ballplayers to carry the catcher into the dressing room . 
Mike Deegan was sitting on the bench , watching . 
When the ballplayers started to carry the catcher off the field he said : `` That ought to teach the sonofabitch '' . 
Phil Rossoff , seated next to Deegan , got up and moved to the other end of the bench . 
The Anniston manager was coming over to the Riverside dugout . 
He was followed by four of his men . 
It began to look as if something was going to happen . 
Mike sat quietly watching the manager come nearer . 
Eddie Lee moved over to Mike Deegan's side . 
No one said a word . 
The Anniston manager came right up to the dugout in front of Mike . 
His face was flushed . 
`` Deegan '' , the manager said , his voice pitched low , quivering . 
`` That was a rotten thing to do '' . 
`` For God's sake '' , Mike said , waving the manager away . 
`` Stop it , will you ? ? 
Tell your guys not to block the plate '' . 
`` You didn't have to ram him '' . 
`` That's what you say '' . 
The Anniston manager looked at Eddie Lee . 
It was a cold and calculated look . 
He turned and went back across the field to his dugout . 
He called in the pitcher who had been pitching , and a big , heavy , powerfully built right hander moved out to the mound for Anniston . 
The game started again and in the eighth inning Mike Deegan came up to bat . 
Everyone in the ball park seemed to be standing and shouting . 
The first ball the hefty pitcher threw came in for Mike's head . 
Deegan fell into the dirt , the ball going over him . 
He arose slowly and brushed himself off . 
He got back into the batter's box and on the next pitch dropped into the dirt again . 
`` Hit the bum '' ! ! 
Somebody yelled from the Anniston bench . 
In the Riverside dugout Frankie Ricco , shortstop , whispered into Phil's ear : `` There's gonna be a fight '' . 
`` Look at those bastards '' ! ! 
Charlie Haydon , a pitcher , said . 
`` They're looking for trouble '' . 
Mike was slow getting into the box this time . 
When he finally did he had to duck his head quickly away as the pitch came in . 
`` Listen '' ! ! 
He shouted to the pitcher . 
`` One more and I'm coming out there '' ! ! 
`` I'll be waiting '' ! ! 
The pitcher yelled back . 
Mike Deegan pounded the rubber plate with the end of his bat . 
He stood flat-footed in the box , but not very close to the plate now . 
The pitcher wound up and the ball came in straight for Mike's head . 
Deegan dropped , got up , turned and , holding the bat with both hands up against his chest , began to walk slowly out to the mound . 
The pitcher tossed his glove away and came towards Mike Deegan . 
They were both walking towards each other , unhurried . 
Riverside and Anniston players rushed out on the field . 
In the next moment , it seemed , the infield was crowded with spectators , ballplayers , cops , kids and a dog . 
There was much shouting and screaming . 
Fights sprang up and were quickly squelched . 
Mike and the Anniston pitcher were pulled away before they even came together . 
Phil Rossoff and two other Riverside players did not go out on the field when the fighting started . 
After the game , Phil was taking off his sweatshirt in the dressing room when Mike Deegan came in . 
`` It's a helluva thing '' , Mike said , looking at Phil , `` when a guy's own team-mate won't come out and help him in a fight '' . 
Phil sighed and pulled the wet sweatshirt over his head . 
Frankie Ricco sat down on the bench near Phil . 
The other players were undressing quietly . 
Eddie Lee had not come in yet . 
Mike went over to Phil and stood over him . 
`` Why the hell didn't you come out when you saw them gang up on me '' ? ? 
`` I didn't think it was necessary '' . 
`` Well ! ! 
Now that's just fine ! ! 
You didn't think it was necessary '' . 
Mike placed both his hands on his hips . 
He pushed his jaw forward . 
`` Listen , wise guy , if you think I'm gonna do all the fighting for this ball club you're crazy '' . 
Mike had a good two inches over Phil and Phil had to look up into Mike's face . 
`` I didn't ask you to fight for the ball club '' , Phil said slowly . 
`` Nobody else did , either '' . 
`` You trying to say I started the fight '' ? ? 
`` I'm not trying to say anything '' . 
Phil turned away and opened his locker , and then he heard Mike Deegan say : `` You're yellow , Rossoff '' ! ! 
And Phil banged his locker door shut and spun around . 
But before anything could happen Frankie Ricco was between them and Eddie Lee had come into the dressing room . 
`` Phil , come into my office '' , Eddie said . 
Phil followed Eddie into the office and shut the door . 
He sat down before Eddie's desk . 
`` I'm doing you a favor '' , Eddie said quickly . 
`` You get your unconditional release as of today '' . 
Phil's eyes widened just a trifle . 
`` The best thing for you to do '' , Eddie said , `` is go home . 
You don't belong in professional baseball '' . 
Phil had to clear his throat . 
`` Is this because of what happened out there '' ? ? 
`` No '' , Eddie said . 
`` But it does confirm what I've suspected all along '' . 
Phil stood up . 
`` Listen ! ! 
This is the second time . 
'' 
`` Sit down , sit down '' , Eddie said . 
`` I'm not saying you're yellow . 
I am saying you're not a professional ballplayer '' . 
Eddie Lee leaned forward over the desk . 
`` Now listen to me , Phil . 
I'm not steering you wrong . 
You haven't got the heart for baseball '' . 
Phil shook his head and Eddie frowned . 
Suddenly his voice grew hard . 
`` What the hell do you think baseball is ? ? 
You're not in the big leagues , but if you can't give and take down here what the hell do you think it'll be like up there '' ? ? 
Phil started to say something but Eddie cut him short . 
`` Now don't tell me what a good ball player you are . 
I know you've got talent . 
But what you haven't got is the heart to back up that talent with . 
The heart , Phil . 
You just haven't got the heart for pro-ball , and that's it '' . 
Dazed , Phil said : `` I don't get it . 
My batting average '' 
Eddie stood up abruptly , then sat down just as abruptly . 
`` What difference does your batting average make ? ? 
Or your fielding average . 
Or even the way you run bases . 
I tell you when it's necessary to hurt in order to win -- you won't do it . 
That's what I mean by no heart for the game . 
Baseball's no cinch . 
Deegan had no business ramming into that kid out there . 
He did it because he knows for each guy he puts out of commission that's one less who might take his job away later on . 
What the hell do you think baseball is ? ? 
A sport ? ? 
It's a way of life , goddamit ! ! 
And you've got to be ready to cut to ribbons anybody who wants to take your way of life away from you '' ! ! 
He's wrong ! ! 
Phil thought . 
It's only his opinion . 
There were other clubs in this league . 
He stood up slowly . 
He was a little pale and shaky . 
His lips felt glued together . 
`` I think you're wrong , Eddie '' , he said finally . 
Eddie nodded . 
`` Okay . 
You'll get your pay in the morning '' . 
Phil turned and left the room , hearing Eddie say : `` Someday you'll see I was right '' . 
Phil shut the door behind him . 
Outside in the dressing room , Frankie Ricco sat on the bench dressed in his street clothes . 
`` What happened '' ? ? 
Frankie asked . 
Phil said : `` I got my release '' . 
`` You crazy '' ? ? 
Phil shrugged . 
`` What for '' ? ? 
Phil sighed . 
Frankie shook his head . 
`` I don't get it '' . 
`` I don't know '' , Phil said . 
They were silent for a few moments . 
Then Frankie said : `` What are you gonna do '' ? ? 
Phil started to take his clothes off and Frankie sat down on the bench again . 
Phil took off one shoe and stared at it . 
`` Don't take it like this '' , Frankie said . 
`` Hell , plenty of guys get let out and come back later . 
The leagues are full of guys like that '' . 
Phil was very quiet . 
`` What are you gonna do , Phil '' ? ? 
Phil did not answer . 
`` Why not try another club '' ? ? 
Phil looked up . 
What the hell right did Eddie have saying a thing like that ? ? 
`` Springfield's in tomorrow '' , Frankie said . 
`` Talk to Whitey Jackson '' . 
He just didn't know what he was talking about , saying a thing like that . 
`` Will you do it , Phil '' ? ? 
`` Do what '' ? ? 
`` Ask Whitey for a job '' . 
Phil nodded . 
`` Sure '' , he said . 
`` Springfield come in tomorrow '' ? ? 
Frankie nodded . 
`` I'll speak to Whitey '' . 
`` Atta boy '' . 
`` I'll talk to him , all right '' . 
`` Don't worry '' , Frankie said . 
`` You'll get a job there . 
He needs outfielders bad '' . 
`` I'm not worried about it '' , Phil said . 
`` That's the way to talk . 
What else did Eddie have to say '' ? ? 
`` Nothing '' , Phil said . 
Richard's next interest seemed the product of his insularity . 
His broad reading took him into certain by-ways of religion and the subject of religion began to fascinate him . 
When he was twelve he took to reading St. Augustine and Aquinas , then Lao-tse , Confucius , Mencius , Suzuki , Hindu tomes by endless Krishnaists and numerous socio-archaeological papers . 
For his birthday , because Richard had seen them in a store and asked for them , his mother bought him the Zend-Avesta and a little image of the Indian god , Acala . 
And one day , on her own , his mother came home with a present entitled The Book of the Dead , which she suspected Richard would enjoy . 
He was enormously happy with her gift and smiled , then went to his room to read . 
At dinner one night , when he was fourteen , Richard announced , `` There is only one god '' . 
`` Did you think there were two '' ? ? 
Grinned his father . 
`` You don't understand '' , Richard said gloomily . 
Through quiet laughter his mother said , `` Don't speak to your father like that , Richard '' . 
Richard seldom spoke anyhow and he didn't speak to his parents about religion again . 
His interest in the formal study of religion waned when he was sixteen and he substituted for it an interest in Asian affairs . 
Although he still didn't speak to anyone , he grew fond of saying , `` The future lies in Asia '' , when the opportunity arose , and when he graduated from high school his parents sent him to New York to give him a foundation , they said , for his life in Asian studies . 
Richard was a solitary student in New York and acquired , in his remoteness , a thorough if bookish knowledge of Asian lore , literature , life , politics and history . 
He was awarded a fellowship to continue his studies in Tokyo and he packed up his clothes , the biwa upon which he had been practicing and his image of Acala , and left to spend a week at home before leaving the country . 
The week at home was not comfortable . 
His mother , who had seen little of him for four years , appeared worried about his sailing off by himself for an Orient which , she herself having slight knowledge of it , had to be distrusted . 
She seemed to work to grow close to her son in the few days he spent at home , talking to him about some of the more pleasant moments of his childhood and then trying to talk to him about those things in which he alone was interested . 
`` Do you still have The Book of the Dead '' ? ? 
She asked him and , laughing , she added , `` I was nervous about buying a book with a title like that , but I knew you'd like it '' . 
`` Yes '' , he lied to shorten the conversation , `` I still have it '' . 
He was no longer able to relax in the presence of his parents and found it difficult to keep up a conversation with his mother or father , no matter the subject . 
As for The Book of the Dead , it along with his other books on religion had been incarcerated in a furnace in the basement of the building in which he had lived in New York . 
He had dusted each of the books carefully and carried them all to the basement and , trembling at having to open the big furnace , given them up to the flames . 
Then he sped from the dark basement and returned to his room and cried . 
Richard left America with his clothes , his biwa and his image of Acala and , on the freighter which took him to Japan , he plucked at the biwa , trying to make the sounds he wrought resemble an ancient Japanese tune he had once heard . 
During his second week at sea he brought the curious melody out of the instrument and suddenly wanted to force the biwa to remain at just that moment in its history when it had given him pleasure . 
He stole from his cabin late that night and crept out into a gusty North Pacific wind and dropped the biwa into the water . 
It was so dark that he didn't see it hit the water and the noisy rush of the ocean kept him from hearing it . 
It was as though the biwa had been eaten up by the wind . 
In Tokyo Richard took up a life similar to that which he had lived in New York , except that he had replaced his biwa with a friend . 
An American student named Charlotte Adams had refused to take notice of his evident aversion to people and had at last succeeded in getting him to talk to her . 
He had nothing much to say to her but that he said anything seemed to please her and he accompanied her on some of her unusually searching tours of Tokyo . 
In Charlotte , Richard saw a frankness and a zest for doing things which , after a fashion , he envied . 
In time , he grew to depend upon her occasional company and she at length was able to encourage him to participate in more social activity . 
She convinced him that he ought to be a member of some of the small tea-drinking parties she held at her rooms and in the end he complied with her wishes , although it was only rarely that he added anything to the random conversations . 
At one such gathering Charlotte announced , `` I was at Ryusenji today . 
Have you ever been to Ryusenji '' ? ? 
No one had . 
`` Well , it's at Fudomae and there was a tan young man , quite naked , taking a shower in the pool . 
I was thoroughly startled '' . 
Richard thought it a more promising remark than any made during the last conversation , but Charlotte's manner during the gatherings was more flippant and superficial than when she was alone with him and he was sure her remark would lead to nothing much better than the pointless words which had preceded it . 
Three of the four persons present , all foreign students in Tokyo , had been playing a game of judging popular Japanese foods by the In and Out system , an equation in which Zen philosophy was used as the modifier . 
Soba , udon and tea were In because they could be taken noisily . 
Sushi was Out because it was pretentious . 
Sashimi was In , Samuel Burns had suggested , because it was too far Out to stay Out , even if it was a little pretentious . 
Richard had kept his eyes down throughout the game , the very sound of the chatter nearly painful to his ears . 
`` He wasn't the least bit disturbed by my watching him '' , said Charlotte . 
`` Did you watch him '' ? ? 
Asked a red-haired girl named Ceecee Witter . 
`` I shouldn't have been able to do that '' . 
`` Well I was able to do it '' , Charlotte said with no sign of irritation . 
`` For a minute , anyhow . 
I'm surprised no one has been there . 
I've been there a number of times . 
Sam , I thought you knew everything about Tokyo . 
You've never been to Ryusenji '' ? ? 
`` I've heard about it '' , Samuel Burns said . 
`` There's a little place there called Lovers Mound dedicated to Gompachi and Komurasaki '' . 
`` Yes , a little parkish place '' , Charlotte said , and concluded , `` Anyhow , it's all very nice . 
And the man who brought sweet potatoes into Kanto is buried there , next to a beautiful seated statue of Fudo . 
Oh , that's what I meant to tell you . 
This is the interesting part , Richard '' , she had a bothersome habit of trying to pull him into the talking . 
`` There was that fellow out there in the bitter cold '' -- 
`` My God , it was cold today '' , said Samuel Burns . 
`` Twenty-two or twenty-three '' . 
`` And the water would be still colder '' , Ceecee seemed to shiver at the thought of it . 
`` And your golden god '' , said Samuel Burns , `` probably went right home and poured himself into a boiling bath . 
It would kill one of us '' . 
`` But the point is '' , Charlotte said , `` there he was , freezing , naked in a little stream of water at Ryusenji , all in worship of Fudo , the god of fire '' . 
Richard's dark eyes came up and seemed for the tiniest moment to reflect sharp light . 
It was true ; ; 
Fudo , the god of wisdom , was also thought of as the Japanese version of Acala . 
The conversation went on but Richard stopped listening . 
He found himself trying to remember something , but he couldn't decide even the nature of what it was he worked to recall . 
He had almost given up when he realized that the dropping of his biwa into the icy jowls of the black Pacific was the memory for which he had been searching . 
Perhaps he sensed some connection between the incident on the freighter and the ascetic at Ryusenji , he was unable to put it together . 
That night , after leaving Charlotte's apartment , Richard walked about for a time before returning to his room . 
When he at last did go to his room , he couldn't sleep and instead paced up and down before his little image of Acala , thinking first of Charlotte's tale of the man at Ryusenji , then of his biwa and the invisible Pacific waters . 
And the next morning , not sure of why he went , he took the train to Fudomae and walked to Ryusenji . 
He was surprised by the sharp sensation he experienced as he approached the pool which Charlotte had mentioned . 
He went through a gate to stand at the edge of the water and gazed at the two thin falls which dropped from large spigots high at the back of the pool . 
On the hillside above was caged what might have been an incarnation of Fudo , or perhaps a demon . 
The strange creature , housed in wire , made him shudder . 
The sensation he so overwhelmingly realized was one which told him he had been there before but he knew he had not , and could not recall any place he had visited to be likened to the limpid green water or the little fountain-falls or the green demon imprisoned beyond his reach . 
He left the pool and climbed the steep stone stairs to the temple , and the sense of familiarity with the place would not leave him . 
Into a little well before the temple he dropped a hundred-yen coin and then he had an urge to sound the bell before the temple , to take hold of the rope and crash it against the circle of bronze ; ; 
but the spirit he wished to call out would not , he knew , come in the person of the temple priest . 
Instead , he walked around the temple and mounted still another flight of stairs and stood before the seated Fudo at their head . 
The black Fudo seemed to stare rigidly back at him and Richard's eyes were caught by the Fudo's in fascination , and then Richard was shocked as , all at once , flames shot out from the sharp features of Fudo's face and there was a terrible metallic scraping sound , as if the large statue were about to burst from some pressure within it . 
Then the flames were gone , the stillness fell upon the severe black face and Richard began to tremble violently . 
Suddenly he emptied his pockets of all his coins and dropped them into the box before the seated Fudo and hurried back down both stairways and away from the temple , never looking back . 
He walked all the miles back to his room . 
He seemed to have picked up a virus that day , because the next morning he had a small cough and felt a bit hot . 
He stayed home , reading and refusing to think about his frightening experience at Ryusenji . 
But the process of refusing to think about it was an active reminder in itself and he couldn't rid himself of a consciousness of it throughout the day . 
The cold lingered , making sleep difficult that night , and he remained in bed still the next morning , now unable to keep from thinking about the inexplicable sight of burning metal , the wretched sound , the unbearable feeling of having been to a remote Tokyo temple at some earlier time in his life . 
All of the elements of the experience were impossible and yet the reality of them was heavy upon him and he resolved never again to visit the temple at Fudomae . 
I was thinking of the heat and of water that morning when I was plowing the stubble field far across the hill from the farm buildings . 
It had grown hot early that day , and I hoped that the boy , my brother's son , would soon come across the broad black area of plowed ground , carrying the jar of cool water . 
The boy usually was sent out at about that time with the water , and he always dragged an old snow-fence lath or a stick along , to play with . 
He pretended that the lath was a tractor and he would drag it through the dirt and make buzzing , tractor sounds with his lips . 
I almost ran over the snake before I could stop the tractor in time . 
I had turned at the corner of the field and I had to look back to raise the plow and then to drop it again into the earth , and I was thinking of the boy and the water anyway , and when I looked again down the furrow , the snake was there . 
It lay half in the furrow and half out , and the front wheels had rolled nearly up to it when I put in the clutch . 
The tractor was heavily loaded with the weight of the plow turning the earth , and the tractor stopped instantly . 
The snake slid slowly and with great care from the new ridge the plow had made , into the furrow and did not go any further . 
I had never liked snakes much , I still had that kind of quick panic that I'd had as a child whenever I saw one , but this snake was clean and bright and very beautiful . 
He was multi-colored and graceful and he lay in the furrow and moved his arched and tapered head only so slightly . 
Go out of the furrow , snake , I said , but it did not move at all . 
I pulled the throttle of the tractor in and out , hoping to frighten him with the noise , but the snake only flicked its black , forked tongue and faced the huge tractor wheel , without fright or concern . 
I let the engine idle then , and I got down and went around the wheel and stood beside it . 
My movement did frighten the snake and it raised its head and trailed delicately a couple of feet and stopped again , and its tongue was working very rapidly . 
I followed it , looking at the brilliant colors on its tubular back , the colors clear and sharp and perfect , in orange and green and brown diamonds the size of a baby's fist down its back , and the diamonds were set one within the other and interlaced with glistening jet-black . 
The colors were astonishing , clear and bright , and it was as if the body held a fire of its own , and the colors came through that transparent flesh and skin , vivid and alive and warm . 
The eyes were clear and black and the slender body was arched slightly . 
His flat and gracefully tapered head lifted as I looked at him and the black tongue slipped in and out of that solemn mouth . 
You beauty , I said , I couldn't kill you . 
You are much too beautiful . 
I had killed snakes before , when I was younger , but there had been no animal like this one , and I knew it was unthinkable that an animal such as that should die . 
I picked him up , and the length of him arched very carefully and gracefully and only a little wildly , and I could feel the coolness of that radiant , fire-colored body , like splendid ice , and I knew that he had eaten only recently because there were two whole and solid little lumps in the forepart of him , like fieldmice swallowed whole might make . 
The body caressed through my hands like cool satin , and my hands , usually tanned and dark , were pale beside it , and I asked it where the fire colors could come from the coolness of that body . 
I lowered him so he would not fall and his body slid out onto the cool , newly-plowed earth , from between my pale hands . 
The snake worked away very slowly and delicately and with a gorgeous kind of dignity and beauty , and he carried his head a little above the rolled clods . 
The sharp , burning colors of his body stood brilliant and plain against the black soil , like a target . 
I felt good and satisfied , looking at the snake . 
It shone in its bright diamond color against the sun-burned stubble and the crumbled black clods of soil and against the paleness of myself . 
The color and beauty of it were strange and wonderful and somehow alien , too , in that dry and dusty and uncolored field . 
I got on the tractor again and I had to watch the plow closely because the field was drawn across the long hillside and even in that good soil there was a danger of rocks . 
I had my back to the corner of the triangular field that pointed towards the house . 
The earth was a little heavy and I had to stop once and clean the plowshares because they were not scouring properly , and I did not look back towards the place until I had turned the corner and was plowing across the upper line of the large field , a long way from where I had stopped because of the snake . 
I saw it all at a glance . 
The boy was there at the lower corner of the field , and he was in the plowed earth , stamping with ferocity and a kind of frenzied impatience . 
Even at that distance , with no sound but the sound of the tractor , I could tell the fierce mark of brutality on the boy . 
I could see the hunched-up shoulders , the savage determination , the dance of his feet as he ground the snake with his heels , and the pirouette of his arms as he whipped at it with the stick . 
Stop it , I shouted , but the lumbering and mighty tractor roared on , above anything I could say . 
I stopped the tractor and I shouted down to the boy , and I knew he could hear me , for the morning was clear and still , but he did not even hesitate in that brutal , murdering dance . 
It was no use . 
I felt myself tremble , thinking of the diamond light of that beauty I had held a few moments before , and I wanted to run down there and halt , if I could , that frenetic pirouette , catch the boy in the moment of his savagery , and save a glimmer , a remnant , of that which I remembered , but I knew it was already too late . 
I drove the tractor on , not looking down there ; ; 
I was afraid to look for fear the evil might still be going on . 
My head began to ache , and the fumes of the tractor began to bother my eyes , and I hated the job suddenly , and I thought , there are only moments when one sees beautiful things , and these are soon crushed , or they vanish . 
I felt the anger mount within me . 
The boy waited at the corner , with the jar of water held up to me in his hands , and the water had grown bubbly in the heat of the morning . 
I knew the boy well . 
He was eleven and we had done many things together . 
He was a beautiful boy , really , with finely-spun blonde hair and a smooth and still effeminate face , and his eyelashes were long and dark and brushlike , and his eyes were blue . 
He waited there and he smiled as the tractor came up , as he would smile on any other day . 
He was my nephew , my brother's son , handsome and warm and newly-scrubbed , with happiness upon his face and his face resembled my brother's and mine as well . 
I saw then , too , the stake driven straight and hard into the plowed soil , through something there where I had been not long before . 
I stopped the tractor and climbed down and the boy came eagerly up to me . 
`` Can I ride around with you '' ? ? 
He asked , as he often did , and I had as often let him be on the tractor beside me . 
I looked closely at his eyes , and he was already innocent ; ; 
the killing was already forgotten in that clear mind of his . 
`` No , you cannot '' , I said , pushing aside the water jar he offered to me . 
I pointed to the splintered , upright stake . 
`` Did you do that '' ? ? 
I asked . 
`` Yes '' , he said , eagerly , beginning a kind of dance of excitement . 
`` I killed a snake ; ; 
it was a big one '' . 
He tried to take my hand to show me . 
`` Why did you kill it '' ? ? 
`` Snakes are ugly and bad '' . 
`` This snake was very beautiful . 
Didn't you see how beautiful it was '' ? ? 
`` Snakes are ugly '' , he said again . 
`` You saw the colors of it , didn't you ? ? 
Have you ever seen anything like it around here '' ? ? 
`` Snakes are ugly and bad , and it might have bitten somebody , and they would have died '' . 
`` You know there are no poisonous snakes in this area . 
This snake could not harm anything '' . 
`` They eat chickens sometimes '' , the boy said . 
`` They are ugly and they eat chickens and I hate snakes '' . 
`` You are talking foolishly '' , I said . 
`` You killed it because you wanted to kill it , for no other reason '' . 
`` They're ugly and I hate them '' , the boy insisted . 
`` Nobody likes snakes '' . 
`` It was beautiful '' , I said , half to myself . 
The boy skipped along beside me , and he was contented with what he had done . 
The fire of the colors was gone ; ; 
there was a contorted ugliness now ; ; 
the colors of its back were dull and gray-looking , torn and smashed in , and dirty from the boy's shoes . 
The beautifully-tapered head , so delicate and so cool , had been flattened as if in a vise , and the forked tongue splayed out of the twisted , torn mouth . 
The snake was hideous , and I remembered , even then , the cool , bright fire of it only a little while before , and I thought perhaps the boy had always seen it dead and hideous like that , and had not even stopped to see the beauty of it in its life . 
I wrenched the stake out , that the boy had driven through it in the thickest part of its body , between the colored diamond crystals . 
I touched it and the coolness , the ice-feeling , was gone , and even then it moved a little , perhaps a tiny spasm of the dead muscles , and I hoped that it was truly dead , so that I would not have to kill it . 
And then it moved a little more , and I knew the snake was dying , and I would have to kill it there . 
The boy stood off a few feet and he had the stake again and he was racing innocently in circles , making the buzzing tractor sound with his lips . 
I'm sorry , I thought to the snake , for you were beautiful . 
I took the broken length of it around the tractor and I took one of the wrenches from the tool-kit and I struck its head , not looking at it , to kill it at last , for it could never live . 
The boy came around behind me , dragging the stake . 
`` It's a big snake , isn't it '' ? ? 
He said . 
`` I'm going to tell everybody how big a snake I killed '' . 
`` Don't you see what you have done '' ? ? 
I said . 
`` Don't you see the difference now '' ? ? 
`` It's an ugly , terrible snake '' , he said . 
He came up and was going to push at it with his heavy shoes . 
I could see the happiness in the boy's eyes , the gleeful brutality . 
`` Don't '' , I said . 
I could have slapped the boy . 
He looked up at me , puzzled , and he swayed his head from side to side . 
I thought , you little brute , you nasty , selfish , little beast , with brutality already developed within that brain and in those eyes . 
I wanted to slap his face , to wipe forever the insolence and brutal glee from his mouth , and I decided then , very suddenly , what I would do . 
Cady didn't come unglued easily , but this had not been a day of glad tidings . 
Tax worries , production worries , personnel worries , and the letter from Hanford College , his own alma mater , a real snapper . 
Hanford realized he had enrolled his son four years ago . 
Yes , the boy's credentials were in order -- scholastic transcript , character references , picture , health record , successful college boards . 
But due to the many applicants on file , would he co-operate and write a personal letter giving them his son's motivation , interests and his qualifications for leadership ? ? 
Cady Partlow lit his pipe with no comfort . 
This was it . 
This was the letter which would or would not enroll his son , David , in Hanford . 
His son who had never held an office in any organization in the eighteen years of his life . 
His son who did not know whether he wanted to be doctor , lawyer , merchant or chief . 
He wondered if he had played it wrong . 
Maybe he should have kept in touch . 
Gone back for reunions . 
But he had been busy building a business , being a big man in his own town just as he had been a big man at Hanford , Class of 1935 . 
Besides , Cady Partlow knew he wasn't the old-grad-type . 
It wouldn't help anyway . 
Look at Pete Alcorn , who hadn't missed a Hanford ball game in fifteen years . 
Pete's son was rejected . 
Hanford College , Little Ivy League , had no room for football players with low grades . 
Cady looked at his own son's scholastic record with pride . 
Good solid B average with a sprinkling of A's in math and science . 
Imagine his son being that good in science ! ! 
Mr. Partlow could still feel a cold sweat on his slightly gray temples as he remembered what a near thing chemistry had been for him at Hanford . 
But then , he hadn't studied very hard . 
Getting elected president of the student body took a lot of time and politicking . 
He put down his pipe and started to type . 
`` In response to your letter , I can in good conscience recommend my son , David , in the field of leadership '' . 
He stopped and looked at the picture of his son , the picture on his desk which had changed with the years from a laughing baby to a candidate for Hanford College . 
He didn't have to be told his son looked like him . 
David had the same gray eyes , high cheekbones , dark hair and a certain rugged ugliness . 
Height , 6' . 
Weight , 160 . 
Health , excellent . 
He turned back to the typewriter with a little more confidence . 
`` His interests range from astronomy and geology to electronics , tennis and swimming . 
His chief motivation for enrolling at Hanford is the desire to '' -- 
Mr. Partlow banged his fist on the keyboard , ruining the letter . 
He paced to the window and looked at the city he had helped to build . 
How do you tell a college president that your son doesn't know what he wants to do ? ? 
That you have refused to drive him into the family business or push him into a profession so you can say at the club , `` Of course David has known since he was twelve he wanted to be an engineer '' -- or a lawyer , or an editor ? ? 
How do you tell a college like Hanford that your son has a vast potential , that he will find himself ? ? 
Just give him time , give him a chance . 
Cady snapped the Venetian blind shut and slammed himself down before the typewriter , rolled in a fresh sheet , and gave his letter the same savage attention he bestowed on a salesman who needed to have the bucket taken off his thick head . 
What a production to make of a letter commending your own son ! ! 
His eyebrow went up in amusement at his soul-searching panic . 
He told Hanford his son wanted to go into the field of electronics . 
He told Hanford his son had participated in numerous high-school activities . 
He belonged to a social club , a civic group , little theater , swimming team , and had been president of the student forum as well as treasurer of the science club . 
He finished with a flurry of good wishes to Hanford College and signed the letter . 
There , that did it . 
Then he met the grave eyes of his wife , Anne , from the photograph next to David's . 
He shoved the unsealed letter into his coat pocket . 
Better show it to Anne and see if he had omitted anything . 
After all , his wife had written most of his letters for him in those first lean days of Partlow Products . 
Anne had a way with words . 
Half of it was natural , half was Smith College . 
Yet the whole of Anne was something she had never learned in any college . 
A woman had it or she didn't . 
Anne had it . 
She said what she meant and let it be . 
She never got on his back . 
He could take the advice or leave it . 
He whistled as he locked the office and grinned as he got on the elevator . 
`` You look like you just heard a real gasser , Mr. Partlow '' . 
Cady looked at Tom , who had taken him up and down for fifteen years . 
`` I was just thinking how things have changed . 
When I went to college they begged you to come . 
Be our guest ! ! 
It's our pleasure ! ! 
Now you have to be well rounded , firm in motivation and pre-packed with knowledge '' ! ! 
Tom slid open the door to the lobby . 
`` That's a fact , Mr. Partlow . 
My John applied to six colleges before he got in '' . 
`` Going to State '' ? ? 
`` No . 
He's president of the rocket club here , you know . 
Always messing around with science stuff . 
Real bright along those lines , you might say . 
He got a science scholarship to Yale '' . 
`` Oh '' , said Mr. Partlow , `` that's fine , Tom . 
Just fine '' . 
As he drove home through the thinning traffic , Cady felt the unease growing . 
He hadn't told anyone , but he , too , had applied to five colleges for David . 
They had all turned down his son . 
Weakness in leadership . 
So sorry . 
Limited interests . 
So sorry . 
No clear motivation . 
So sorry . 
He suddenly realized when he walked into his own pretty darned expensive house that he needed the Martini Anne had waiting for him . 
But tonight his drink tasted like branch water and even his favorite meal of steak and tossed salad gave no surcease from the growing weight of the letter in his pocket . 
Nor did looking at Anne ease the tension as it usually did . 
He liked looking at Anne . 
Most people did . 
He liked her blond hair and the sprinkle of freckles across her nose . 
From those navy-blue eyes she saw things as clearly and honestly as David did . 
She always could sense the shag end of a woolly day . 
`` Board meeting tonight , Cady '' ? ? 
`` No , I begged off . 
Work to do '' . 
`` Can I have the car , Dad '' ? ? 
`` Why not let him take it , Cady ? ? 
I know it is midweek , but it's only eight days before commencement . 
Let's forget the rules '' . 
Cady , deep in thought , neither heard nor answered . 
David grinned . 
Carefully he put down his steak knife and said loudly , `` Mr. Chairman '' ! ! 
Cady Partlow's head came up like that of the proverbial fire horse . 
`` I'm sorry , Dave . 
The car ? ? 
Of course you can have it '' . 
Dave ate two pieces of pie as he did everything else , slowly , methodically and with interest . 
`` Hear anything from Hanford yet , Dad '' ? ? 
Cady begged the question . 
`` Don't worry about it , Dave . 
Your acceptance will come through '' . 
Dave shrugged on his sports coat and picked up the car keys . 
`` Don't be too sure , Dad . 
Charles Burke got turned down by Dartmouth and he is a straight-A student '' . 
Anne said it wasn't surprising because Charles was antisocial , a lone wolf , and completely one-sided . 
`` I can hardly say the same about you , Dave '' ! ! 
Dave kissed her lightly . 
`` Girls , my dear parent , are here to stay ! ! 
Get my old man to bed early . 
He looks a little bit frayed '' . 
Anne waited until the door had slammed and picked up the coffeepot . 
`` Let's go into the library . 
You do seem somewhat tattered '' . 
Cady trailed her with the coffee cups and settled into his favorite chair in the comfortable book-lined room . 
`` I didn't know I looked so dilapidated '' ! ! 
`` Wrong word , darling . 
Your fur has been rubbed the wrong way and you show it . 
Need any help '' ? ? 
`` In a way , yes . 
Hanford College hasn't decided on Dave's application yet . 
They want a letter from me on his motives , interests and leadership . 
Here's what I wrote '' . 
Cady handed her the letter , drank his coffee and waited with what he suddenly realized was belligerence . 
Already he could feel Anne's questioning eyes . 
`` I know you wrote this in a hurry , but , Cady , Dave was only acting president of the student forum for a few days . 
That was when half the school was down with flu '' . 
`` But he was president '' . 
`` And he wasn't really elected treasurer of the science club . 
He just took over the week Bill Daley was in the state basketball play-off '' . 
Cady stuck his jaw out . 
`` The fact remains he was treasurer '' . 
`` And the swimming team . 
No , Cady , he made second team . 
Just missed the first '' . 
`` A team is a team '' , insisted Cady . 
`` Anything else '' ? ? 
`` Yes '' , she said quietly . 
`` I don't think you've been quite honest , Cady . 
It isn't like you . 
David's interests . 
Astronomy . 
He was mad about stars at the age of nine . 
Geology , You and Dave used his rock collection for the bottom of the fishpond six years ago ! ! 
Those aren't his interests now '' . 
`` What do you suggest '' ? ? 
`` Just say he likes swimming , tennis , chess and music '' . 
`` Music ! ! 
He hasn't been to a symphony concert all season '' . 
Anne smiled . 
`` But he plays bass with Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts '' ! ! 
`` You mean that rock-and-roll combo ? ? 
Even in that he never solos like Jack on guitar or Rich on sax . 
He's -- he's just there , that's all '' . 
`` Yes , he's just there . 
He keeps the beat going . 
He likes to play bass because he doesn't have to solo . 
He doesn't like to rise and shine . 
Don't worry , Cady , he'll be back in the Beethoven fold by next year '' . 
Cady appeared slightly mollified . 
`` All right . 
But I refuse to be brutally honest and mention Chief Crazy Horse and his Five Colts '' . 
Anne laughed and Cady felt the tension loosen its grip on the back of his neck . 
`` Maybe I am padding it a bit , Anne '' , he said . 
`` But you know how hard it is to get a boy into a good college . 
He has to have leadership as well as grades '' . 
Anne folded the worrisome document . 
`` Did you know he is advertising his ham-radio equipment for sale this weekend ? ? 
He hasn't used it now for several years . 
Can you really say his motivation for college is electronics '' ? ? 
Cady felt the jolt as though he had stepped off the curb on his heel . 
`` And what would you say he wants to do ? ? 
Just what '' ? ? 
`` It's Dave who is applying to Hanford College . 
Why don't you ask him '' ? ? 
For once Cady Partlow wished Anne would yell at him so he could yell back . 
`` I have talked to him , but you know I've never tried to push him into any profession . 
I won't be guilty of trying to run his life '' . 
Anne picked up the towel she was hemming for the hospital guild . 
`` Just because your father tried to make a banker out of you , you've leaned over backward to keep your hands off . 
But subconsciously you've wanted him to conform to your mold . 
You want him to be a leader of men , like you '' . 
Cady put the well-worn chip back on his shoulder . 
`` Dave has qualities of leadership . 
He just hasn't developed them yet . 
Give him time '' . 
He never will , Cady . 
Not the kind of leadership you mean , working with lots of people . 
All your wishful thinking won't change that . 
Remember what you used to say in the Army ? ? 
You can't run a war with ninety-nine generals and one private '' ! ! 
Cady walked the block to the mailbox , almost ashamed of himself for arguing with Anne . 
Martin felt it was incredible that the situation had come to exist at all . 
And once begun , had grown to such monstrous proportions . 
The pair of white cotton shorts ruled his life . 
Lying awake at night , he could see them , laid out on the floor of his mind . 
When he rose in the morning , the image was still there . 
He had always been a messy and negligent man . 
In his bachelor days , his bedroom had been strewn with clothes which his mother , or later the hotel maid , generally saw fit to put in order . 
No doubt Dolores resented following in their footsteps . 
But it was fun those first days , kidding about the trail of garments he left littered across the rug . 
There was an assertive maleness in his grinning refusal to pick them up . 
Half slyly he enjoyed seeing her stoop to lift the things . 
He remembered the first time he saw her , standing across the room at a party . 
The smooth curve of her neck , very white against hair which curled against it like petals . 
Her hair was the color of those blooms which in seed catalogues are referred to as `` black '' , but since no flower is actually without color contain always a hint of grape or purple or blue -- he wanted to draw the broad patina of hair through his fingers , searching it slowly for a trace of veining which might reveal its true shade beneath the darkness . 
So he sought her out , and spoke to her , and thought of his hand in her hair . 
Or against her back , pressed on the column of vertebrae , which held her so magnificently straight and unyielding , until the segments of bone made tiny sharp cracking noises , like the snapped stem of a tulip . 
But , to put it bluntly , nothing snapped . 
Yet that had not seriously troubled him , not then . 
They married . 
More he could take at leisure . 
All Martin thought he needed was time : to what better use could time be put ? ? 
He saw later that they had made their marriage too quickly . 
There was too little occasion beforehand for resistance , the brave strong delights of emotional clash and meeting . 
They had left themselves too much to discover . 
But , at the start , his new life felt invigorating . 
Good . 
It was on the tenth day after the wedding ( how could it have been so soon ? ? 
) that he dropped the shorts on the floor . 
`` Now , I'm not going to pick up those shorts '' ! ! 
Martin gave her a teasing pat . 
`` I think you'll get tired of them there '' . 
In the morning the shorts were where he had left them . 
He smiled to himself , and decided not to mention them till Dolores did . 
It was almost too easy . 
For he had just remembered : tonight they were having their first guests . 
The shorts would not be on the floor when he came home that evening . 
He was wrong . 
The rest of the bedroom had been groomed to a superhuman neatness , but in the middle of the carpet lay the disheveled shorts . 
They gave the room a strange note of incongruity , like a mole on a beautiful face . 
He saw that Dolores intended to wait until the last minute , thinking he would get nervous . 
Quietly he determined to foil her . 
I can be as stubborn as she can , he thought ; ; 
my nerves are as strong . 
She'll rush to the bedroom when the doorbell rings . 
It rang . 
Ten minutes early . 
Martin was standing a few feet from the front door . 
He swung around , eyes toward the bedroom , some fifteen feet away . 
Dolores stood motionless in the doorway . 
He could not cross the living room , brush past her , and bend down to retrieve the shorts . 
Martin turned his back . 
He strode to answer the bell . 
Bill's hat was deposited in the hall closet . 
With the most casual and relaxed manner in the world , Dolores led Anthea to the bedroom . 
Martin strained his ears . 
At first he could not be sure . 
Then he caught just enough to know that the shorts were still there . 
A glissade of giggles slid over their voices . 
All evening Anthea favored him with odd , coy looks . 
Clearly she had been instructed `` not to say a word '' . 
For some reason , this ellipsis in the conversation spread until it swallowed up every other topic . 
At last there was a void no one could fill . 
The Brainards went home early . 
Martin realized , later on , that he should have `` had it out '' with Dolores that night . 
As violently as possible . 
But he was so taken aback , he could not believe any rage of his would make her give in . 
On the contrary , it would only weaken his position if he fumed , while she stayed calm and adamant . 
And if he surrendered after raving at her . 
He shivered . 
Suppose he ran up the white flag altogether ? ? 
At once . 
He considered the sober possibility . 
In his head was the echo of those titters with Anthea . 
There was something about private feminine whisperings which always made him feel scabrous and unclean . 
He remembered his mother gossiping with her neighborhood women friends , lowering her voice to a penetrating hoarseness which might be trusted to carry to the head of the stairs , where he crouched listening . 
He could even recall the last time he sat there . 
She was talking about him that time , because he had done some bad thing , something she disliked , but `` Afterwards Martin said he was sorry . 
He apologized so sweetly , I couldn't keep being annoyed with him '' . 
It wasn't even true that he'd said he was sorry that time ; ; 
he had in fact said simply that he wished the thing hadn't happened , which was as honest as he could put it . 
But his mother told the story over and over , till her `` Martin said he was sorry '' was as much a part of her as the shape of her thin , pallid ears . 
The battle had to be fought . 
Let the best sex win . 
But his resolution hardly seemed to help . 
If the situation had been bad , it now got worse . 
About this time people began `` dropping in '' , considering that the newly married had been left alone long enough . 
Angrily Martin wished they had delayed the wedding and gone on a trip -- preferably one that lasted months -- instead of deciding not to postpone the date until he could get away . 
Here they were at the mercy of anyone who chose to come by . 
These stray people nearly always insisted on Dolores showing them around the apartment . 
Of course , the tours of inspection included the ever-present shorts . 
It was curious how the different visitors took this . 
Some tried to ignore the blot on the bedroom's countenance . 
Others asked . 
Quite a few laughed . 
To them all Dolores told a lighthearted and witty tale . 
`` It's a little contest Martin and I have '' , she would begin gaily , carrying the anecdote through a frothy and deceptive course . 
While he waited in the living room . 
Once Martin went along . 
They entered the bedroom , and Dolores said nothing . 
Then one of the guests showed his merriment . 
`` You were in a hurry , weren't you '' ? ? 
Martin would have liked to break the man's neck . 
Dolores smiled ; ; 
she let the interpretation stand . 
Now Martin heard himself give a snort of mock good nature . 
With her eyes Dolores dared him for the truth , ready to begin : It's a little contest -- 
Never again did he enter into the ritual of showing the apartment . 
They kept up a rigid pretense of speaking relations . 
But Martin seldom felt the impulse to talk about anything . 
What to talk about ? ? 
Dolores kept picking up any of his clothes ( except the fatal shorts ) which he left about , but he had been robbed of pleasure in scattering his possessions . 
He fell into the habit of putting his clothes in drawers and closets , so his life might impinge as little as possible on hers . 
The shorts alone remained . 
In his moments of worst agony , Martin imagined what his friends were saying . 
The sound of their amazement . 
Bizarre : He could hear the word . 
The most bizarre situation . 
We were up to visit them and 
He had thought her exactly what he wanted . 
Six weeks of marriage and I'm using the past tense , he told himself furiously . 
Pursuing his idea , he saw that it would be impossible to leave her now . 
Everyone would know why ; ; 
he would cut a supremely ridiculous figure . 
He was trapped . 
Day and night Martin could not drag his mind from the dilemma he had made for himself . 
His mind scurried frantically , seeking an exit . 
Alternately he had periods of hostile defeatism in which he determined sullenly , morosely , to live out his life in this fashion . 
Nothing would change , nothing would ever change . 
When the solution finally came to him , one night while he was in bed , he was so shaken by its simplicity that he could only wonder why it had not occurred to him before . 
In a frenzy of excitement , he considered his plan . 
Beside his shorts , he would place something of hers . 
Instantaneously he would have won an immeasurable moral victory , for if she picked up , say , a pair of her panties , she might just as well lift his shorts lying alongside -- the expenditure of energy was almost the same . 
He felt that it would be a particular humiliation to Dolores to pick up her own underwear which he had laid on the floor . 
Furthermore , he could go on repeating the maneuver endlessly : every time he went in the bedroom , he could drop a slip or a brassiere , or maybe a girdle , next to his shorts . 
Sooner or later , Dolores would crack . 
On the other hand , if she didn't remove her own things , it would be difficult to explain to the parade of guests which traversed the apartment . 
Martin guessed that Dolores would not be so eager to tell the next installment of her story . 
The tale , he thought , would become less gay . 
She had used his rumpled shorts as the very image of his childishness , his lack of control , his general male looseness , while she remained cool , airy , and untouched , the charming teacher who disciplined an unruly body . 
To have her underclothes linked with his on the floor would draw her visibly into a struggle both bitter and absurd . 
Something in the back of his mind was aware that the magnificence of the plan lay in his faith , that the idea would work because he believed in it , since his courage and virility were involved , because it was truly his . 
The knowledge kept him from analyzing his scheme to death , and took him through the last hours of that night in a peace of exalted fanaticism . 
The next morning , while Dolores was out of the room , he went to her bureau drawer , took out a pair of nylon lace pants , and tenderly dropped them next to his shorts . 
He sat down on the bed . 
In a surprisingly short time , Dolores appeared . 
To his delight , her eyes focused at once upon the two garments . 
Slowly and deliberately she reached down and touched the lace with her fingers , then hesitated for about a second . 
Ah , he thought , she's going through the chain of reasoning which says she might really just as well pick up my shorts too . 
He saw that in a moment she had grasped all the implications of a plot which had been weeks in occurring to him . 
Extending her fingers another inch , she caught up the shorts , and swiftly left the room . 
She did not look at him , but he noticed that her face was flushed and her eyes unsteady . 
They breakfasted together , but Martin did not refer to his triumph , and Dolores found a great deal to do in the kitchen , bobbing up and down from the table so that talk was impossible . 
Well , Martin thought , That'll save . 
He left for work in high spirits . 
As he relaxed that day , Martin realized how tense he had been these past weeks . 
He found that he no longer hated Dolores ( he knew how much he had hated her ) , and he was surprised at a resurgence of an affectionate feeling . 
`` Good old A-Z '' , Cap said . 
`` You know , I've got one of your cars at home . 
As a prominent industrialist , you ought to be interested in his nibs' support group . 
Isn't his racket down your alley '' ? ? 
Once it was , William thought . 
But not any more . 
A rush of memory swept him back , and he forgot Cap . 
How did he start on such a ride to brief glory ? ? 
Simply enough , through the inadvertent agency of his brother-in-law . 
General Hershey's draft and Doc Eddyman and Cap were responsible for his first eminence , but Fearless Freddy Bryan could take credit , if he cared to ( and he did ) , for the second time . 
Freddy needed a job , having been detached from a rather dangerous career in real estate and skyscraper financing by Gerry , and it was up to Arthur Willis to provide him with one . 
Mr. Willis bought Zenith Plastic Products , a skeleton corporation of sorts which had undergone many vicissitudes and whose principal assets were a couple of electronics plants on Long Island engaged in working out government contracts , and installed Freddy in an executive position . 
Shortly after , Freddy had his usual proliferation of bold ideas . 
Willis listened patiently , and once in a while William was exposed to them at a family gathering ; ; 
he generally heard Freddy's suggestions without interest , being absorbed by his own prospering concerns . 
Probably Mr. Willis was influenced toward deeper involvement by familial loyalty and a concern for his grandchildren . 
Gerry began to aid Freddy with her father , prodded , no doubt , by Joan's open contempt for Freddy and William's irritating competency . 
Another factor must have been the eventual disposal of Willis' fortune ; ; 
she unquestionably assumed that the more he was entwined with Freddy , the more likely he was to reward Freddy richly upon his death . 
Whatever the reasons , Willis and Bryan started expanding Zenith . 
They acquired another electronics factory , a specialized ceramics company , an organization that built -- very experimentally -- high-speed research calculators . 
Since they were hunting for national defense contracts , Adam Herberet , a man of surprising resources , entered the combination as a silent partner because of his political connections . 
Feeling his power , Freddy looked for additional worlds to conquer . 
Heavy industry , slanted toward inexhaustible government coffers , attracted him . 
The Allstates Auto Company , a medium-sized firm which manufactured four-wheel-drive vehicles and other off-road equipment , had recently constructed an over-large , modern plant in a burst of misguided optimism . 
Cursed with a shaky management and dissatisfied stockholders , it was ripe for amalgamation , and Freddy's instinct was to keep growing by stock mergers and small expenditure of cash , and never mind inevitable consequences . 
With Herberet's blessing , he was convinced that Allstates' Wisconsin folly would be ideal for conversion to airplane sub-assembly , tanks , missiles or ordnance of some kind . 
At that point William came into the picture . 
Although not much desiring the account , he had been appointed advertising head of Zenith . 
Freed of routine by having his own firm and a complaisant partner , his work in New York had given him a broader overall knowledge of business administration and corporate structure ; ; 
and if he wasn't entirely committed to what he did , he was at least fascinated by the chance of wider opportunities . 
Mr. Willis , eager to have him allied with the family , wanted advice beyond the confines of his field , and William set out on a serious study of the situation , including trips to Wisconsin and Washington . 
In the end , he said : `` I'm not enchanted by the proposition , sir . 
I know a guy named Jack Hamrick , a very bright young engineer who was with Chrysler , and I took him with me to Allstates . 
It's his expert opinion that the plant isn't well suited to what you have in mind . 
The conversion will cost a fortune . 
Besides that , I'm acquainted more or less with the defense hardware situation through my contacts in the Air Force . 
I think Adam Herberet is guilty of being too hopeful and better informed on defense financing than on the technical side . 
Missiles have thrown everything up for grabs , and nobody seems to be sure where we go from here . 
The future of manned aircraft is in doubt , which affects government procurement , and jet transports have revolutionized the airline trade -- one jet can take the place of three compound-engine planes . 
This means the aircraft companies are going to tear into the government market , looking for anything they can get and making the competition tough . 
Here are a few facts and figures I've assembled . 
Can't you stay with what you have and wait till the dust settles '' ? ? 
Willis glanced at the bound pages given him and shrugged . 
`` Well '' , he said , `` there is Freddy , you know . 
And Gerry . 
Freddy is deeply committed to our plans already . 
He assures me he has people to handle the money raising , and Ham Richert , my lawyer , says the legal aspects of the wedding of Zenith and Allstates are no problem . 
I don't like to exhibit the deadly dampening effect of an elderly man's caution '' . 
`` Yes , I appreciate that . 
I wish you wouldn't tell Freddy I'm lukewarm ; ; 
I've caused him trouble before , and he's beginning to resent me . 
If we don't take care , the sisters will be entering the fray on opposite sides , brandishing their cudgels '' . 
`` Which is a frightful prospect , Bill '' . 
Willis laughed . 
`` One shouldn't mix commercial affairs with patriarchy , but in this case I have no choice . 
Let me think about it . 
I'm most grateful to you , so grateful I wish you were my principal aide instead of Freddy '' . 
Not to William's surprise , Freddy , Adam and Hamilton Richert prevailed ; ; 
allied to them was Gerry , devoting much time to swaying her father , and Joan dismissed all thought of the project and William was unwilling to interfere further . 
Zenith absorbed Allstates , stock transfers were arranged , and Freddy became president of the hyphenated combination . 
Through Jack Hamrick , William fell into the world of automobile promotion and got several accounts for Shoals and Clay . 
He forgot about A-Z till , unhappily , he and Hamrick were proved correct . 
Freddy's backing dropped away from him and Mr. Willis was forced to make up the deficit . 
Adam , beset by changing defense conditions and the open secret that he was part of the new corporation , couldn't deliver from his end . 
The Wisconsin plant turned out to be a white elephant . 
Stock Willis held in abundance fell sharply in value . 
Confronted by a grim future , Freddy lost his nerve and plumped for a drastic liquidation . 
Once more Willis summoned William . 
`` You were right '' , he said -- `` you and your engineer -- and I'm in something of a bind . 
Freddy's solution doesn't appeal to me . 
In addition to other defects , I'm a stubborn man and hate to admit to the common garden variety of bad judgment . 
Will you see if you can help me '' ? ? 
William spent a long week end closeted with Hamrick . 
His recent experience in motor car advertising , a love for cars of themselves , the existence of A-Z's useless Wisconsin set-up , exposure to exciting conceptions of Hamrick's that nobody would buy , and the coincidental recent failure of a respected but out-dated small-car manufacturer called Ticonderoga Motors had given him an idea of such dimensions he was almost afraid to broach it . 
Initially , Hamrick's reaction to A-Z going into the passenger car market was discouraging . 
He thought the financing , the advertising , the production of new models , the founding of a nationwide chain of dealerships was simply too difficult . 
Then he caught fire . 
If A-Z could buy Ticonderoga cheaply and use their presses and dies and other equipment , if William could hit precisely the right promotion note , if the money hurdle was not insurmountable . 
They took nearly a month to investigate , marshal statistics , and put their arguments down in black and white . 
Taking Hamrick with him , William went to Mr. Willis . 
He was surprised and dubious , but impressed by the engineer and the report . 
`` Your alternative is breathtaking '' , he said , `` and , I'm frank in saying , a bit mad . 
I wish I was younger and less timid . 
Well , I can't resolve this myself . 
I'll have to call in the brain trust . 
Are you willing to run the gantlet ? ? 
I can't guarantee you a sympathetic audience '' . 
`` We'll be in there swinging '' , William said , `` but in a way , sir , you've got to decide it yourself . 
You have the controlling interest and the principal expenditure is yours -- and , besides , nobody else is going to have the courage . 
If they follow anyone , it'll have to be you '' . 
He paused . 
`` I should explain : there's more here for me than advocating my little dream , there's you . 
You mustn't take a fall , or publicly back away . 
I hate that . 
You're -- you're Arthur Willis . 
Forgive the hearts and flowers theme '' . 
`` I rather like the music '' , Willis replied quietly . 
`` Thank you '' . 
At the meeting , attended by Freddy , Richert , Herberet and the A-Z executive staff , with Mr. Willis presiding , William and Hamrick did indeed run the gantlet . 
From shock and incredulity , most of the listeners went on to open resistance and animosity . 
`` Oh , my God '' , Ham Richert said , `` a little child shall lead them . 
Move over , General Motors '' . 
`` It's absurd , Bill '' , Freddy said , from a pale face . 
`` You're leading Dad down the garden path '' . 
`` Your garden , God damn it '' ! ! 
William said . 
`` I don't enjoy family quarrels '' , Adam said . 
`` Nor crazy relatives . 
We're here to transact business . 
Can't we put an end to this , Arthur '' ? ? 
`` Hear me out , please '' , William begged . 
`` I'm an advertising hustler , I admit , but I have to get hot once in a larger sphere . 
Sure , Ticonderoga went broke in the low-priced market bucking the Big Three . 
Their cars weren't small enough , they didn't have the power , they were old-fashioned . 
They tried to sell 'em on economy and simple merit . 
We've arrived at an age for romance and snobbery . 
We've all been rich and spoiled long enough to hate the machine age . 
Look what those little European jobs are doing . 
We'll woo the consumer with a product , not bludgeon him with chromed excess length and weight . 
Let's make it moonlight and the call of far places and a seduction , at reasonable rates . 
Ticonderoga folded a few minutes too soon , before the tide changed , still honest and stupid -- and the network of dealers the company had is around waiting to be signed up again -- waiting for us , ready-made . 
We've got rid of the steam yachts and Georgian houses , and the bloated , too-expensive automobile is next . 
Why not come down smartly in the world , in a chic fashion , with an Allstates-Zenith '' ? ? 
He swayed them somewhat , but the debate raged on . 
Financing emerged as the main obstacle . 
Mr. Willis made it evident that he had contributed his maximum . 
`` Nobody will underwrite it , I'm telling you '' , Freddy said . 
`` I know what I'm talking about in that department '' . 
`` There's plenty of risk money '' , Ham Richert added , `` but not for anything this risky '' . 
`` All right '' , William said . 
`` We'll try to swing the deal on that basis . 
If we can't raise the capital , we're through . 
Nothing has been lost . 
You're up against it anyhow . 
Why won't you give me a chance '' ? ? 
A silence fell . 
Heads instinctively turned in Willis' direction . 
He smiled at William and slowly rubbed his hands together . 
`` I feel I must answer the question '' , he said , `` since the onus later , if any , should fall on me -- I don't relish recriminations spread broadcast outside my family . 
I'm not giving you a chance , Bill , but availing myself of your generous offer of assistance . 
Good luck to you '' . 
`` All the in-laws have got to have their day '' , Adam said , and glared at William and Freddy in turn . 
Sweat started out on William's forehead , whether from relief or disquietude he could not tell . 
Across the table , Hamrick saluted him jubilantly with an encircled thumb and forefinger . 
Nobody else showed pleasure . 
Spike-haired , burly , red-faced , decked with horn-rimmed glasses and an Ivy League suit , Jack Hamrick awaited William at the officers' club . 
`` Hello , boss '' , he said , and grinned . 
`` I suppose I can never expect to call you ' General ' after that Washington episode '' . 
`` I'm afraid not '' . 
It was among these that Hinkle identified a photograph of Barco ! ! 
For it seems that Barco , fancying himself a ladies' man ( and why not , after seven marriages ? ? 
) , had listed himself for Mormon Beard roles at the instigation of his fourth murder victim who had said : `` With your beard , dear , you ought to be in movies '' ! ! 
Mills secured Barco's photograph from the gentleman in charge , rushed to the Hollywood police station to report the theft , and less than five minutes later , detectives with his picture in hand were on the trail of Cal Barco . 
On their way , they stopped at every gas station along the main boulevards to question the attendants . 
Finally , at Ye Olde Gasse Filling Station on Avocado Avenue , they learned that their man , having paused to get oil for his car , had asked about the route to San Diego . 
They headed in that direction and , at San Juan Capistrano By-the-Sea came upon Barco sitting in the quaint old Spanish Mission Drive-in , eating a hot tamale . 
At the moment , Barco's back was to the road so he didn't see the detectives close in on his convertible which , in their quest for the stolen lap rug , they proceeded to search . 
The robe , however , was missing , for by that time Barco had disposed of it at a pawnshop in Glendale . 
The detectives placed Barco under arrest and , without informing him of the nature of the charge , took him back to Hollywood for questioning . 
Thus it was that Barco , apprehended for mere larceny , now began to suspect that one or another of his murders had been uncovered . 
During the return trip , Barco kept muttering to himself in meaningless phrases , such as : `` They're under sand dunes They're better off , I tell you I saved their souls '' . 
The detective , commenting on Barco's behavior , felt that he merely belonged among the myriad citizens of our community who are mentally unhinged -- that he was a more or less harmless `` nut '' ! ! 
However while in his cell awaiting trial for theft , Barco , in a fit of apprehension , made an attempt to take his own life . 
The attempt had failed because , when endeavoring to cut his wrists , this murderer of seven women had fainted at the sight of blood . 
The jail authorities -- attaching no particular significance to the episode -- offered Barco whisky to revive him ; ; 
but the old fellow , a lifelong teetotaler , refused it , and no more was thought of the matter . 
Then it was that District Attorney Welch entered the case . 
A man of vaulting ambition , with one eye on the mayorship of Los Angeles , nothing ever escaped him which might possibly lead to personal publicity . 
It was reported to Welch's office that a thief in the city jail had attempted suicide . 
Welch wanted to know why . 
No one knew . 
Now Welch had a pet theory that everyone is guilty of breaking more laws than he ever gets caught at . 
The suicide attempt looked to him like an opportunity to put his theory to the test . 
So he paid a call on Barco in his cell and began their chat by stating bluntly : 
`` Barco , we've got the goods on you ! ! 
It'll be a lot better if you come clean '' . 
At first Barco was evasive and shifty . 
But with Welch's relentless pursuit of the subject , Barco finally `` broke '' and started confessing to one murder after another . 
By the time Barco reached the count of three , the situation seemed to Welch almost too good to be true . 
But if true , it was the case of which he had dreamed , the case which would throw him into headlines all over America as the hero of a great murder trial . 
Welch summoned jail officials to Barco's cell . 
But to Welch's chagrin , the police captain pooh-poohed Welch's credulity in Barco's confession . 
Barco was clearly a `` nut '' . 
It required strength , bravado , daring to commit murder . 
`` That worm a murderer ? ? 
Ridiculous '' ! ! 
Then , for the first time since his arrest , a glint of spirit lit Barco's eyes . 
His manhood had been attacked . 
He stiffened and rose to his feet . 
He'd show them ! ! 
`` Is that so '' ? ? 
He queried . 
`` Well , for ten years I've been murdering women . 
I can lead you to every one of the bodies , and there ain't four , nor five , nor six of 'em -- there's seven ! ! 
'' 
The next day the police captain , in derision , organized what he termed `` Welch's Wild Goose Chase '' . 
For indeed it seemed incredible that anyone could go on committing murder for ten years and not get caught at it , even in Hollywood . 
The searching party consisted of the police captain , Welch , Barco , policemen with shovels , newspaper reporters , and cameramen . 
Barco , his state of apprehension gone , never to return , had assumed a matter-of-factness which remained his principal attitude from that time on . 
He directed the cortege of autos to the sand dunes near Santa Monica . 
Stopping the cars at a fork in the road , he got out , paced off a certain distance to a spot between two shrub-covered sand hills , and indicated a location . 
Orders were given to dig . 
Nothing was found . 
Welch was worried . 
The police captain chortled . 
The newspaper boys cracked jokes and again Barco's pride was aroused . 
With greater precision he again paced off a location , this time a little more to the left . 
With quibs and gibes , the policemen again started digging . 
Welch was on edge . 
The captain was remarking that it was a nice day for a picnic when finally one of the shovels struck an object . 
`` There's something here '' ! ! 
Said the digger . 
Joking stopped and everyone gathered around . 
The digger , thrusting about with his shovel , now raised into view a package crudely wrapped in one of the murderer's Hollywood sport shirts . 
Although it was a mere fragment of the victim's remains , it was enough . 
Welch was wild with delight . 
His elation grew as Barco's seven disclosures brought to light one reward after another . 
Now did Welch truly become the man of the hour , and everything that followed in the procedure of Justice was a new triumph for him . 
It went to his head , and his ambition increased . 
It was apparent that Welch was in cahoots with Marshall and would use his power as D.A. to drag every possible sensation into the case . 
Every new scandal which would provide more `` copy '' for Marshall's pen would thus mean more publicity for Welch . 
I knew that both these cynics were waiting with impatience for the dramatic moment when Viola was called to the stand . 
Once there , the D.A. with devilish cleverness would provide Marshall with headlines : `` Viola's Multiple Romances '' `` Viola Lake an Addict '' `` Downfall of Another Film Idol '' ! ! 
It would be fine publicity for the man who was willing to walk to the mayor's throne over the broken reputation of a helpless girl ! ! 
I studied Welch closely as the trial progressed for any hint which might give me a lead as to how he might be thwarted . 
It wasn't long before I sensed that there was something deeper than overvaulting ambition back of his desire for Viola's destruction . 
He was bitter and resentful toward her , personally resentful . 
A dreadful fear entered my consciousness that perhaps he had entertained aspirations toward Viola's favors -- or , even more serious perhaps , that he had attained a share of them and had then been superseded by some luckier chap . 
I did not rest until I had tracked the mystery down . 
Well , here it is . 
One day over a year before , there had been a cocktail party in an apartment of a downtown hotel . 
Viola had been urged to attend , by telephone , and not knowing the host or the character of the party , she had gone . 
She arrived late and as she entered the party , noted that gentlemen seemed to be in the majority ; ; 
the air was thick with smoke , empty bottles were in evidence , and several of the guests were somewhat the worse for liquor . 
Naturally , Viola had no wish to remain , but she felt she couldn't leave so soon after her arrival , in all politeness to her host . 
And it so happened that adjacent to a couch on which she had taken refuge was a small table on which she noted a vase of red rosebuds ; ; 
while projecting from beneath the couch were a pair of feet which , as Fate would have it , belonged to District Attorney Welch . 
As Viola sat there , a playful impulse overcame her to remove the shoes and socks from the unidentified feet and , as a prank , insert rosebuds between the toes . 
A little later the district attorney woke up , emerged from under the couch , looked at his watch , and realized he had an engagement that very hour to address a meeting of the Culture Forum on `` The Civic Spirit of the Southland '' , in the Byzantine room of the hotel where his wife , as president of the forum , was to preside . 
He made his way to his host's bedroom where he carefully brushed himself off , neatly arranged his hair , and painstakingly selected his hat from the many on the bed . 
Then , noting neither the absence of his footwear nor the presence of the rosebuds , he made his way to the Byzantine room and , with his usual dignity , mounted the rostrum . 
The effect on the intellectuals among his audience may well be imagined . 
The incident , aside from reflecting on Welch's political career , had all but wrecked his home life . 
He never rested until he discovered who the culprit was , and when he did , he vowed vengeance on Viola Lake if ever the chance came his way . 
And here it was ! ! 
By such innocent actions are human tragedies sometimes set in motion . 
During these first days of the trial I didn't have as much time to commiserate with Viola as I should have liked . 
In the first place , it was difficult for us to meet . 
We couldn't be seen together , for the tongue of Scandal was ever ready to link our names , and the tongue of Scandal finds but one thing to say of the association of a man with a girl , no matter how innocent . 
I couldn't invite Viola to our house , for Mother snobbishly refused to receive her . 
Now the Czarship had not affected my own sense of social values , but Mother had attained a reflected glory through it , which had opened the doors of Los Angeles-Pasadena Society to her . 
There , Mother was received by the scions of aristocratic lines which are dominated by the Budweisers ( of beer derivation ) , the Chalmers ( of underwear origin ) , and the Heinzes ( whose forbears founded a nationally famous trade in pickles ) . 
I hated being dragged into the salons of these aristocrats . 
But Mother insisted , for it is seldom indeed that anyone remotely connected with the cinema is ever received in their exclusive midsts . 
In fact , it was not until the King of Spain had visited at Pickfair that Mary and Doug were beckoned to cross the sacred barriers which separate Los Angeles and Pasadena from the hoi-polloi . 
Mother even went so far as to trump up for me matrimonial opportunities with Pasadena debs who had been educated abroad , and with those of the more lenient Los Angeles area where a debutante was a girl who had been to high school . 
But at long last came a time when I broke away from Mother and her society `` chi-chi '' in order to spend a cosy evening with Viola and her chaperon at her home . 
However , such a hotbed of gossip had grown up during the trial , that every precaution had to be taken to keep my visit from being whispered to the world , Society , and even , alas , to my own mother . 
When I arrived at Viola's I was shown , to my surprise , into the kitchen . 
Viola greeted me , in checked apron , ladle in hand , and explained it was the cook's night out and that she herself was preparing dinner . 
I sat and watched proceedings . 
There was to be roast chicken with dressing , giblet gravy , asparagus , new peas with a sprig of mint , creamed onions , and mashed potatoes -- all chosen , prepared , and cooked by Viola herself . 
I realized that Hamlet was faced with an entirely different problem , but his agony could have been no greater . 
The most that was accomplished was adding Mrs. Beige's tray to the dish pile , and by means of repeated threats , on an ascending scale , seeing that the girls dressed themselves , after a fashion . 
I was saved from making the decision as the phone rang , and the girls were upon me instantly . 
Here's a household hint : if you can't find your children , and get tired of calling them , pick up the phone . 
No matter if your children are at the movies , in school , visiting their grandmother , or on a field trip in some distant city , they will be upon you magically within seconds after you pick up the phone . 
Jennie and Miranda twined themselves around me , murmuring endearments . 
Louise climbed onto a stool and clutched the hand with which I was trying to hold the phone , claiming my immediate attention on grounds of extreme emergency . 
Somehow managing to get out a cool , poised , `` Won't you hold on a second , please '' , I covered up the mouthpiece , and with more warmth and less poise , gave a quick lecture on crime and punishment , mostly the latter , including Devil's Island and the remoter reaches of Siberia . 
I promised to illustrate the lecture , if they so much as breathed till after the call was completed . 
Speaking into the phone again and recognizing the caller , I resumed my everyday voice . 
Soon we were deep in a conversation that was interrupted many times by little things like Jennie's holding her breath and pretending to black out , Miranda's dumping the contents of the sugar bowl on the table , and various screeches , thuds , and giggles . 
Under the circumstances , I had difficulty keeping up with the conversation on the phone , but when I hung up I was reasonably certain that Francesca had wanted to remind me of our town meeting the next evening , and how important it was that Hank and I be there . 
I discovered that the girls had shrewdly vacated the kitchen , and were playing quietly in the living room . 
It seemed that I would be the gainer if I accepted the peace and quiet , instead of carrying out my threats . 
Resolving to get something done , I started in on the dishes . 
No . 
I'm not saying it right . 
What I meant to say was that I started to start in on the dishes by gathering them all together in the kitchen sink . 
They looked so formidable , however , so demanding , that I found myself staring at them in dismay and starting to woolgather again , this time about Francesca and her husband . 
How about them , I thought . 
Francesca and Herbert were among the few people we knew in Catatonia . 
We didn't even know them till about a month after we moved -- at that time , they had called on us , after I met Fran at a PTA meeting , and had taken us in hand socially . 
They had been kind to us and we were indebted to them for one or two pleasant dinners , and for information as to where to shop , which dentist , doctor , plumber , and sitter to call ( not that there was much of a choice , since Catatonia was just a village ; ; 
the yellow pages of the telephone book were amazingly thin ) . 
They were `` personalities '' . 
Herb , an expert on narrow ties , thin lapels , and swatches , was men's fashion editor of Parvenu , the weekly magazine with the tremendous circulation . 
Fran and he had met about two years after she had arrived in Manhattan from Nebraska , or was it Wyoming ? ? 
She was the daughter and sole heiress of either a cattle baron or an oil millionaire and , having arrived in New York with a big bank roll , became a dabbler in various fields . 
She patronized Greenwich Village artists for awhile , then put some money into a Broadway show which was successful ( terrible , but successful ) . 
It was during her `` writing '' period that she and Herb met and decided that they were in love . 
They were married at a lavish ceremony which was duly recorded in Parvenu and all other magazines and newspapers , and then they honeymooned in Bermuda . 
No , not Bermuda . 
Bermuda was not in style that year . 
They had honeymooned in Rome ; ; 
everyone was very high on Rome that year . 
They had bought their house in Catatonia after investigating all the regions of suburbia surrounding New York ; ; 
they had chosen Catatonia because of its reputation for excellent schools , beaches , and abundance of names . 
`` You are bound to get involved with people when you have children '' , Fran had told me at our first meeting , `` so it is good to know that those with whom you get involved are not just dreary little housewives and dull husbands , but People Who Do Things '' . 
I admired their easy way of doing things but I couldn't escape an uneasiness at their way of always doing the right things . 
Their house was a centuries-old Colonial which they had had restored ( guided by an eminent architect ) and updated , and added on to . 
It had a gourmet's corner ( instead of a kitchen ) , a breakfast room , a luncheon room , a dining room , a sitting room , a room for standing up , a party room , dressing rooms for everybody , even a room for mud . 
It was all set up so there would be no dust anywhere and so that their children would color in the coloring room , paint in the painting room , play with blocks in the block house , and do all the other things in the proper rooms at exactly the right time . 
Their two boys were `` well adjusted '' and , like their parents , always did the right thing at the right time and damn the consequences . 
Francesca and Herbert considered themselves violently nonconformist and showed the world they were by filling their Colonial house with contemporary furniture and paintings and other art objects ( expensive , but not necessarily valuable , contemporary things ) . 
Fran flaunted her independence by rebelling against the Catatonia uniform of Bermuda shorts and knee-length socks by wearing Bermuda shorts and knee-length socks in colors ; ; 
bright pinks and plaids and vivid stripes . 
Sometimes she even wore the uniform in solid , unrelieved black , and with her blonde hair cut so closely , wearing this uniform , she strongly resembled a member of the SS. . 
No one could dislike them , I thought . 
Sometimes , though , they did not seem quite human . 
It seemed , indeed , that their house was not so much a home , but rather a perfect stage set , and that they were actors who had been handed fat roles in a successful play , and had talent enough to fill the roles competently , with nice understatement . 
Practically the only enthusiasm they showed was when they were discussing `` names '' ; ; 
even brand names . 
You should hear the reverence in Fran's voice when she said `` Baccarat '' or `` Steuben '' or `` Madame Alexander '' . 
She always let it be known that there was wine in the pot roast or that the chicken had been marinated in brandy , and that Koussevitzky's second cousin was an intimate of theirs . 
I wouldn't have wasted time puzzling over this couple were it not for my fear that all the other inhabitants of Catatonia were equally unreal . 
I couldn't feel at home among them . 
Besides Francesca , there was Blanche . 
Francesca was pleasant and charming , but Blanche was sweet . 
Yes , Blanche was very , very sweet -- being in her company was like being drowned in warm , melted marshmallows . 
I had once been a witness when Blanche had smiled and said with only minimum ruefulness , `` Oh , my souffle has collapsed '' . 
Anyone knows how a real , red-blooded woman would react to such a catastrophe ! ! 
If Blanche had been honest , she would have yelled , slammed at least a couple of doors , and thrown a few little , valueless things . 
But dear me , no ; ; 
not Blanche . 
After five minutes with Blanche , one might welcome the astringency of Grazie , who was a sort of Gwen Cafritz to Francesca's Perle Mesta . 
Francesca and Grazie were habitual committee chairmen and they usually managed to be elected co-chairmen , equal bosses , of whatever PTA or civic project was being launched . 
They were inseparable , not because they were fond of each other , but because they wanted to keep an eye on each other , as they were keen rivals for social leadership . 
Grazie was mean : quietly mean , and bitterly , unfunnily sarcastic . 
She it was who had looked to see if I was wearing shoes upon learning that I couldn't drive . 
Grazie had a small , slick head and her hair and skin were the color of golden toast . 
She lived in an ultra-modern house whose decoration , appointments , paint , and even pets were chosen to complement her coloring ; ; 
the pets were a couple of Siamese cats . 
Her uniform was of rich , raw silk , in a shade which matched her hair , skin , housepaint , and cats , and since she was so thin as to be almost shapeless , she rather resembled a frozen fish stick . 
The husbands of these women and others I had met in Catatonia were distinguished only in that they were , to me at least , indistinguishable . 
I couldn't tell one from the other . 
Like Herbert , they were all in communications : radio , television , magazines , and advertising . 
One or two were writers of books ; ; 
all were fellows of finite charm . 
Each had developed a hair-trigger chuckle and the habit of saying `` zounds '' ! ! 
In deference to country-squirehood . 
I never thought I'd live to hear people chuckle and say `` zounds '' ! ! 
In real life . 
I wouldn't have missed it for anything . 
They were `` sincere '' -- men of the too-hearty handclasp and the urgent smile . 
These boys acknowledged an introduction to anybody by gently pressing one of his hands in both of theirs , while they gazed , misty-eyed with care , into the eyes of the person they were meeting . 
Could such unadulterated love , for a total stranger , be credited ? ? 
They were always leaping to light cigarettes , open car doors , fill plates or glasses , and I mistrusted the whole lot of them to the same degree that I mistrusted bake shops that called themselves `` Sanitary Bake Shops '' . 
`` O ! ! 
Pioneers ! ! 
'' I thought , and wondered what kind of homesteads such odd pioneers would establish in this suburban frontier ; ; 
pioneers who looked like off-duty gardeners even at parent-teacher conferences and who never called the school principal `` Mister '' . 
I sighed , thinking that among other things , people here seemed to be those who would have to cut down if they earned less than $85,000 yearly ; ; 
people who would give their teeth for a chance to get on `` Person to Person '' ; ; 
people who thought it was nice to be important , but not important to be nice ; ; 
who were more ingratiating than gracious , more personalities than persons . 
In my estimation , they were people who read Daphne du Maurier , and discussed Kafka ; ; 
well , not discussed him exactly , but said , `` Kafka '' ! ! 
Reverently and raised their eyes , as if they were at a loss to describe how they felt about Kafka , which they were , because they had no opinions about Kafka , not having read Kafka . 
They were , I felt , people invariably trying to prove not who , but what they were , and trying to determine what , not who , others were . 
Becoming aware that it was nearly lunchtime , I brought myself back to the tasks at hand . 
I made plans for the afternoon -- doing the breakfast and luncheon dishes all at once , making the beds , and then maybe painting the kitchen . 
Then , I remembered that the girls had had a banana for dessert every day for the last week . 
`` Bananas '' ! ! 
Jennie had shouted each time . 
`` They're not dessert ! ! 
They're not even food . 
They're just something you're supposed to put on cereal for breakfast '' . 
I dug around and found a mix , and was able to surprise them with a devil's-food cake with chocolate icing . 
( Sometimes I think you need only one rule for cooking : if you can't put garlic in it , put chocolate in it . 
) 
The cake was received in a stunned silence that was evidence in itself of the dearth of taste thrills Mama had been providing . 
Then Jennie closed her eyes , stretched forth her arms , and said : `` Take my hand , Louise ; ; 
I'm a stranger in paradise '' . 
Needless to say , I was furious at this unparalleled intrusion upon free enterprise . 
How dared they demand to `` snoop '' in private financial records , disbursements , confidential contracts and agreements ? ? 
`` It is as though '' , I said on the historic three-hour , coast-to-coast radio broadcast which I bought ( following Father Coughlin and pre-empting the Eddie Cantor , Manhattan Merry-go-round and Major Bowes shows ) `` That Man in the White House , like some despot of yore , insisted on reading my diary , raiding my larder and ransacking my lingerie ! ! 
'' My impassioned plea for civil rights created a landslide of correspondence and one sponsor even asked me to consider replacing the Eddie Cantor comedy hour on a permanent basis . 
But what quarter could a poor defenseless woman expect from a dictator who would even make so bold as to close all of the banks in our great nation ? ? 
The savage barbarian hordes of red Russian Communism descended on the Athens that was mighty Metronome , sacking and despoiling with their Bolshevistic battle cry of `` Soak the rich ' ! ! 
After an unspeakable siege , lasting the better part of two months , it was announced that the studio `` owed '' the government a tax debt in excess of eight million dollars while I , who had always remained aloof from such iniquitous practices as paying taxes on the salary I had earned and the little I legally inherited as Morris' helpless relict , was `` stung '' with a personal bill of such astronomical proportions as to `` wipe out '' all but a fraction of my poor , hard-come-by savings . 
I was also publicly reprimanded , dragged through the mud by the radical press and made a figure of fun by such leftist publications as The New Republic , The New Yorker , Time and The Christian Science Monitor . 
It was then that I availed myself of the rights of a citizen and declared the income tax unconstitutional . 
The litigation was costly and seemingly endless . 
I fought like a tigress but by the time I appealed my case to the Supreme Court ( 1937 ) , Mr. Roosevelt and his `` henchmen '' had done their `` dirty work '' all too well , even going so far as to attempt to `` pack '' the highest tribunal in the land in order to defeat little me . 
Presidential coercion had succeeded not only in poisoning the courtiers , `` toadies '' and sycophants of the `` bench '' against me , but it had been so far-reaching as to discourage any lawyer in the nation from representing me ! ! 
I was ready , like Portia , to present my own brief . 
But the Supreme Court wouldn't even hear my case ! ! 
My plea was unanimously voted down and `` thrown out '' . 
Again , my name was on all the front pages . 
I was , it seemed , persona non grata in every quarter , but not entirely without a staunch following of noted political thinkers and students of jurisprudence . 
As Charles Evans Hughes said , `` Miss Poitrine's limitations as an actress are exceeded only by her logic as a litigant '' . 
Albert Einstein was quoted as saying : `` The workings of the woman's mind amaze me '' . 
Henry Ford spoke of me as `` utterly astounding '' . 
Heywood Broun wrote : `` Belle Poitrine is the most original thinker since Caligula '' , and even F.D.R. had to concede that `` if the rest of this nation showed the foresight and patriotism of Miss Poitrine , America would rapidly resemble ancient Babylon and Nineveh '' . 
Not only were the court costs prohibitive , but I was subjected to crippling fines , in addition to usurious interest on the unpaid `` debts '' which the government claimed that Metronome and I owed -- a severe financial blow . 
Nor , as Manny said , had the notoriety done my career `` any good '' . 
My enemies were only too anxious to level against me such charges as `` reactionary '' , `` robber baroness '' , and even `` traitor '' ! ! 
Traitor indeed ! ! 
I point now with pride to the fact that , long ere the Committee on Un-American Activities , the Minute Women , the Economic Council and other such notable `` watchdog '' organizations were so much as heard of , I was Hollywood's leading bulwark against communism , fighting single-handedly `` creeping socialism '' against such insuperable odds as the Fascio-Communist troops of the NRA , PWA , WPA , CCC and an army of more than twenty-two million mercenaries whom F.D.R. employed secretly , through the transparent ruse of regular `` relief '' checks . 
Needless to say , my art suffered drastically during this turbulent period . 
Could it do otherwise ? ? 
Even though I have always had a genius for `` throwing myself '' into every role and `` playing it for all it's worth '' , no actress can be expected to do her best work when her fortune , her reputation , her livelihood , her home and her nation itself are all imperilled . 
Such sweeping distractions are hardly conducive to `` Oscar '' winning performances . 
I tried my hardest , with little help , may I say , from my husband and leading man , but somehow the outside pressures were too severe . 
Having ( through my unflagging effort and devotion ) achieved stardom , a fortune and a world-renowned wife at an age when most young men are casting their first vote , Letch proceeded to neglect them all . 
Never a `` quick study '' , he now made no attempt to learn his `` lines '' and many a mile of film was wasted , many a scene -- sometimes involving as many as a thousand fellow thespians -- was taken thirty , forty , fifty times because Miss Poitrine's co-star and `` helpmate '' had never learned his part . 
Each time Letch `` went up '' in his `` lines '' , I was the one to be patient , helpful and apologetic while he indulged in outbursts of temperament , profanity and abuse , blaming others , going into `` sulks '' and , on more occasions than I care to count , storming off the `` set '' for the rest of the day . 
As for his finances , I was never privileged to know exactly how much money Letch had `` salted away '' . 
It was I who paid for our little home , the food , the liquor , the servants -- even Letch's bills at his tailor and the Los Angeles Athletic Club . 
Never once did he buy me a single gift and for our third anniversary he gave me a dislocated jaw . 
( But that is another story . 
) As for his private monies , they were rapidly dissipated in drinking , gaming and carousing . 
More than once I was confronted by professional gamblers , `` bookies '' , loan `` sharks '' , gangsters , `` thugs '' and `` finger men '' -- people of a class I did not even know existed -- to repay my husband's staggering losses , `` or else '' I shuddered to think that someone so dear to me could even associate with such a sinister milieu . 
And at three different times during our turbulent marriage strange girls , with the commonest of accents , telephoned to announce to me that Letch had sired their unborn children ! ! 
Having the deepest of maternal instincts , my heart fairly bled when I thought of the darling pink and white `` bundles from heaven '' I would have proudly given my husband . 
`` Ah , you're too old '' , was invariably his ungallant and untrue retort whenever I suggested `` starting a family '' . 
Letch had made it abundantly clear that he did not care for the company of my own precious daughter . 
I now felt it wiser to keep Baby-dear in school and -- during the summers -- at a camp run by the Society of Friends all year around . 
Her presence only made Letch more distant and irritable and , in the hurry of buying Chateau Belletch , I had neglected to consider a room for Baby-dear , so there was no place to put her , anyhow . 
( I sometimes feel that God , in His infinite wisdom , wants us to have these inexplicable little lapses of memory . 
It almost always works out for the best . 
) 
Yet I adored this man , Letch Feeley , why , I cannot say . 
With faint heart and a brave smile , I endured his long absences from Chateau Belletch , his coldness , his indifference , his slights and his abuse . 
The times I can recall when I was publicly humiliated by him -- lovely dinner parties in our Trianon Suite where the collation was postponed and postponed and postponed , only to be served dry and overcooked at a table where the host's chair was vacant ; ; 
a `` splash party '' at the new pool , which I had built in the hope of keeping Letch away from public beaches , when Letch and a certain Aquacutie stayed underwater together for the better part of an hour ; ; 
a lovely Epiphany party at Errol Flynn's , on which sacred occasion Letch stole away with an unknown `` starlet '' , leaving me `` high and dry '' to get home as best I could . 
These are but a sampling of the insults I endured . 
As Mrs. Letch Feeley , was it any wonder that I , once the social arbiter of Filmdom , was excluded from the smart entertainments given by the Astaires , the Coopers , the Gables , the Colmans , the Rathbones , the Taylors , the Thalbergs and such devout , closely knit families as the Barrymores and the Crosbys ? ? 
As Letch's antisocial conduct increased , our invitations decreased and my heart was in my mouth whenever I played hostess at a fashionable `` screenland '' gathering . 
Between 1935 and 1939 Letch and I made ten films together , each less successful , both artistically and commercially , than the one before it . 
Our last joint venture , Sainted Lady , a deeply religious film based on the life of Mother Cabrini , and timed so that its release date would coincide with the beatification of America's first saint in November , 1938 , was a fiasco from start to finish . 
As I was playing Mother Cabrini , the picture was actually `` all mine '' , with nearly every scene built around me . 
But in order to keep Letch in the public eye and out of trouble , I wrote in a part especially for him -- that of a dashing ruffian who `` sees the light '' and is saved by the inspiring example of Mother Cabrini . 
And did he appreciate my efforts on his behalf ? ? 
Did he trouble to memorize the very small part which I had `` tailor-made '' to his specifications , a role eventually cut down to three short speeches ? ? 
Did he show the rest of the cast -- numbering four thousand -- the consideration of arriving at the studio punctually -- or even at all ? ? 
He did not ! ! 
The `` shooting '' went on for eight months ! ! 
Most of our working days were spent on the telephone calling `` bookies '' , illegal gambling dens , a certain `` residential club for young actresses '' , more than a hundred different bars or the steam room of the athletic club . 
Whenever he deigned to appear at the studio he was `` hung over '' , uncooperative , rude and insulting . 
He made many tasteless , irreverent and unfunny remarks , not only about me in the title role , but about religion in general . 
By the time the film was released we were three million dollars over-spent , war was imminent and the public apparently had forgotten all about Mother Cabrini . 
Thanks to Letch Feeley and the terrible strain he imposed on me , the notices were few and unfavorable . 
Only George Santayana seemed to understand and appreciate the film when he wrote : `` Miss Poitrine has perpetrated the most eloquent argument for the Protestant faith yet unleashed by Hollywood '' . 
But it was small consolation . 
In a rare fit of anger and spite , I `` farmed out '' my own husband to a small and most undistinguished studio to make one picture as a form of punishment . 
( An actor must have discipline . 
) The film was called The Diet of Worms , which I felt was just what Letch deserved . 
It turned out to be a life of Martin Luther , of all things ! ! 
It was a disaster ! ! 
In clothes , Letch simply did not project . 
He was laughed off the screen . 
At the same time , however , I availed myself of the services of that great English actor and master of make-up , Sir Gauntley Pratt , to do a `` quickie '' called The Mystery of the Mad Marquess , in which I played a young American girl who inherits a haunted castle on the English moors which is filled with secret passages and sliding panels and , unbeknownst to anyone , is still occupied by an eccentric maniac . 
It was a `` potboiler '' made on a `` shoestring '' and not the sort of film I like , as all I had to do was look blank and scream a great deal . 
My heart was not in it , but , oddly enough , it remains the most financially successful picture of my career . 
( I watched it on television late one night last week and it `` stands up '' remarkably well , even twenty years later . 
) 
Letch had returned from his debacle unrepentant and more badly behaved than before . 
I really loved that boy , and , in a feverish attempt to preserve our marriage and to try to revive the wonderful , wonderful person Letch had once been , I took my troubles to Momma , hoping that her earthy advice would help me . 
`` If I could only think of something at the studio , near me , to absorb his boundless energy '' , I said . 
`` What is Letch interested in '' ? ? 
`` Bookies , booze and babes '' , Momma said bluntly . 
Her reply stung me , but this was too important to let my hurt make any difference . 
`` I can't turn the studio into a gambling hell or a saloon '' , I said . 
Up to date , however , his garden was still more or less of a mess , he hadn't even started his workshop and if there was a meadow pond in the neighborhood he hadn't found it . 
It wasn't his fault that these things were so . 
The difficulty was that each day seemed to produce its quota of details which must be cleaned up immediately . 
As a result , life had become a kind of continuous make-ready . 
Once he disposed of these items which screamed so harshly for attention , he could undertake the things which really counted . 
Then , at last , his day would fall into an ordered pattern and he would be free to read , or garden or just wander through the woods in the late afternoon , accompanied by his dogs . 
His dogs ? ? 
He had almost forgotten them , although they had played such an important part in his early dreams . 
Then they had always been romping around him on these walks , yelping with delight , dashing off into the bushes on fruitless hunting expeditions , returning to jump up on him triumphantly with muddy paws . 
Dogs did something to one's ego . 
They were constantly assuring you that you were one of the world's great guys . 
Regardless of how much of a slob you knew yourself to be , you could be certain they would never find out -- and even if they did it would make no difference . 
Now it became increasingly apparent that there were to be no dogs in the picture . 
What in the world were you going to do with a lot of dogs when you left for town on Monday afternoons ? ? 
You certainly couldn't take them into the little apartment and if you tried to farm them out for two or three days every week they would become so confused that they would have nervous breakdowns . 
Why in the world couldn't he live in one place the way everyone else seemed to ? ? 
It worried him , this inability to get the simplest things done in the course of a day . 
He would wake up in the middle of the night and fret about it . 
How in the world had he formerly found time to build up a business , raise a family , be on half a dozen boards , work actively on committees and either go out in the evening or plow through the contents of a bulging brief case ? ? 
Was it possible that as people grow older the nature of time changed ? ? 
Could it be that it speeded up for the aged in some mysterious way , as if a bored universe were skipping through the end of the chapter just to get it over with ? ? 
Or was the answer less metaphysical ? ? 
Did older people work more slowly ? ? 
Did it take a man of sixty-five longer to write a letter , shave , clean out a barn , read a newspaper , than a man of thirty ? ? 
Did men become perfectionists as they grew older , polishing , polishing , reluctant to let go ? ? 
It might be that certain people were born with a compulsion to complicate their lives , while others could live blissfully motionless almost indefinitely , like lizards in the sun , too indolent to blink their eyes . 
Perhaps it was his misfortune , or good fortune , whichever way one looked at it , to belong to the former group , and he was struggling unconsciously to build up pressure in a world which demanded none , which was positively antagonistic to it . 
And then again perhaps the reason why he couldn't find time to do any of the things he had planned to do after retirement : reading , roaming , gardening , lying on his back and watching the clouds go by , was because he didn't want to do them . 
There was no compulsion behind them . 
They could be done or left undone and nobody really gave a damn . 
During all his busy life he had only done things which had to be done . 
This habit had become so fixed over the years that it seemed futile to do anything for which no one was waiting . 
He looked at the luminous dial of his wrist watch . 
It was five minutes after four . 
On some distant farm a rooster crowed and , far down the valley , an associate answered . 
He turned over impatiently and pulled the sheet over his head against the treacherous encroachment of the dawn . 
At least he could buy the equipment for his workshop . 
Thus committed , action might follow . 
He went down to Mills and Bradley's Hardware Store and bought a full set of carpenter's tools , including a rotary power saw and several other pieces of power machinery that Mr. Mills said were essential for babbiting and doweling , whatever they were . 
He also bought a huge square of pegboard for hanging up his tools , and lumber for his workbench , sandpaper and glue and assorted nails , levels and T squares and plumb lines and several gadgets that he had no idea how to use or what they were for . 
`` There '' , said Mr. Mills . 
`` That'll get you started . 
Best not to get everything at once . 
Add things as you find you need 'em '' . 
He didn't even ask the cost of this collection . 
After all , if you were going to set up a workshop you had to have the proper equipment and that was that . 
When he returned home , the station wagon loaded with tools , Jinny had gone with a friend to some meeting in the village , using the recently purchased second car . 
He was glad . 
It gave him a chance to unload the stuff and get it down to the cellar without a barrage of acid comments . 
He had made such a fuss about buying that second car that he knew he was vulnerable . 
He piled everything neatly in a corner of the cellar and turned to stare at the blank stone wall . 
That was where the pegboard would go on which he would hang his hand tools . 
In front of it would be his workbench . 
The old nightmare which had caused him so many wakeful hours came charging in on him once more , only this time he couldn't pacify it with a sleeping pill and send it away . 
How in the world did one attach a pegboard to a stone wall ? ? 
How did one attach anything to a stone wall , for that matter ? ? 
After the pegboard there would be the paneling . 
He sat down on an old box and focused on the problem . 
Perhaps one bored holes in the stone with some kind of an electric gadget . 
But then , when you stuck things into the holes , why didn't they come right out again ? ? 
It all seemed rather hopeless . 
He turned his attention to the workbench . 
Perhaps that was the first thing to do . 
A workbench had a heavy top and sturdy legs , but how did you attach sturdy legs to a heavy top so that the whole thing didn't wobble like a newborn calf and ultimately collapse when you leaned on it ? ? 
Mr. Mills had done some figuring on a scrap of paper and given him the various kinds of boards and two-by-fours which , properly handled , would , he had assured him , turn into a workbench . 
They lay on the cellar floor in a disorderly pile . 
Mr. Crombie poked at it gingerly with his foot . 
How could anyone know what to do with an assortment like that ? ? 
Perhaps he had better have someone help him put up the pegboard and build the workbench -- someone who knew what he was about . 
Then at least he would have a place to hang his tools and something to work on . 
After that everything should be simpler . 
He went upstairs to phone Crumb . 
To his amazement he reached him . 
Mr. Crumb was laid up with a bad cold . 
He didn't seem to think that attaching a pegboard to a stone wall was much of a problem and he tossed off the building of the worktable equally lightly . 
The only trouble was that he himself was tied up on the school job . 
That was why he hadn't been able to finish the porch . 
No , he didn't know of any handyman-carpenter . 
There wasn't any such thing any more . 
Carpenters all wanted steady work and at the moment every mother's son for twenty miles around that could hammer nails for twenty-five dollars a day was working on the school job . 
There was a fellow named Blatz over Smithtown way . 
Nobody liked to hire him because you never could tell when he was going to be taken drunk . 
Mr. Crumb would probably see him at Lodge Meeting the next night . 
If he was sober , which was doubtful , he'd have him get in touch with Mr. Crombie . 
Mr. Blatz had been at least sober enough to remember to telephone and he turned out to be the greatest boon that had come into Mr. Crombie's life since he moved to Highfield , in spite of the fact that he didn't work very fast or very long at a time , and he didn't like to work at all unless Mr. Crombie hung around and talked to him . 
He said he was the lonely type and working in a cellar you saw funny things coming out of the cracks in the wall if they wasn't nobody with you . 
So Mr. Crombie sat on a wooden box and talked in order to keep Mr. Blatz's mind from funny things . 
At the same time he watched carefully to see how one attached pegboards to stone walls , but Mr. Blatz was usually standing in his line of vision and it all seemed so simple that he didn't like to disclose his ignorance . 
While Mr. Blatz was putting up the pegboards and starting the workbench , Mr. Crombie told him of this idea about paneling the whole end of the cellar . 
Mr. Blatz agreed that this would be pretty . 
Without further discussion he appeared the next morning with a pile of boards sticking over the end of his light truck and proceeded with the paneling , which he then stained and waxed according to his taste . 
`` Now '' , he said , `` we got to put in some outlets for them power tools ; ; 
then a couple of fluorescent lamps over the workbench an' I guess we're about through down here '' . 
It all did look very efficient and shipshape . 
There was no question of that . 
`` By the way '' , said Mr. Blatz , packing his tools into a battered carrier , `` them power tools needs extra voltage . 
I guess you know about that . 
Before you use 'em the light company's got to run in a heavy line and you'll need a new fuse box for the extra circuits . 
That ain't too bad 'ceptin' the light company's so busy you can't ever get 'em to do nothin' '' . 
Instead of being depressed by this news , Mr. Crombie was actually relieved . 
At least the moment was postponed when he had to face the mystery of the power tools . 
He followed Mr. Blatz up the cellar stairs . 
As usual , Mrs. Crombie was standing in the midst of a confusion of cooking utensils . 
Mr. Blatz sat down in the only unoccupied kitchen chair . 
`` Well '' , he said , `` got your man fixed up nice down there . 
He oughta be able to build a new house with all them contraptions '' . 
Mr. Crombie watched his wife with an anxious expression . 
`` I was just sayin' to him that I'm all ready now for anything else you want done '' . 
Mr. Crombie couldn't remember his saying any such thing . 
`` Oh , that's wonderful '' , cried Mrs. Crombie . 
`` I have a thousand things for you to do . 
Doors that won't open , and doors that won't close and shelves and broken -- '' 
`` But those are the things I built the workshop for '' , protested Mr. Crombie . 
`` Those are the things I can do , now that I'm set up '' . 
`` I've been waiting to get these things done for months '' , she said . 
`` We won't live long enough if I wait for you , besides which you don't need to worry -- there'll be plenty more '' . 
But the discussion was academic . 
Mr. Blatz was already taking measurements for a shelf above the kitchen sink . 
Ambiguity 
Nothing in English has been ridiculed as much as the ambiguous use of words , unless it be the ambiguous use of sentences . 
Ben Franklin said , `` Clearly spoken , Mr. Fogg . 
You explain English by Greek '' . 
Richard Brinsley Sheridan said , `` I think the interpreter is the hardest to be understood of the two '' . 
And a witty American journalist remarked over a century ago what is even more true today , `` Many a writer seems to think he is never profound except when he can't understand his own meaning '' . 
There are many types of ambiguity and many of them have been described by rhetoricians under such names as amphibology , parisology , and other ologies . 
In common parlance they would be described as misses -- misinterpreters , misunderstanders , misdirectors and kindred misdeeds . 
One species of ambiguity tries to baffle by interweaving repetition . 
`` Did you or did you not say what I said you said , because Jane said you never said what I said '' ? ? 
Another woman , addressing Christmas cards , said to her husband : `` We sent them one last year but they didn't send us one , so they probably won't send us one this year because they'll think we won't send them one because they didn't last year , don't you think , or shall we '' ? ? 
Such ambiguous exercises compound confusion by making it worse compounded , and they are sometimes expanded until the cream of the jest sours . 
Ambiguity of a non-repetitious kind describes the dilemma one girl found herself in . 
`` I'm terribly upset '' , she told a girl-friend . 
`` I wrote Bill in my last letter to forget that I had told him that I didn't mean to reconsider my decision not to change my mind -- and he seems to have misunderstood me '' . 
Evidently Bill was another of those men who simply don't understand women . 
Another case involves a newspaper reporter who tripped up a politician . 
`` Mr. Jones , you may recall that we printed last week your denial of having retracted the contradiction of your original statement . 
Now would you care to have us say that you were misquoted in regard to it '' ? ? 
Questions like this , framed in verbal fog , are perhaps the only kind that have ever stumped an experienced politician . 
They recall Byron's classic comment : `` I wish he would explain his explanation '' . 
Similarly , when a reporter once questioned Lincoln in cryptic fashion , Lincoln refused to make any further statement . 
`` I fear explanations explanatory of things explained '' , he said , leaving the biter bit -- and bitter . 
The obscurity of politicians may not always be as innocent as it looks . 
`` Senator '' , said an interviewer , `` your constituents can't understand from your speech last night just how you stand on the question '' . 
`` Good '' ! ! 
Replied the Senator . 
`` It took me five hours to write it that way '' . 
The misplaced modifier is another species more honored in the observance of obscurity than in the breach . 
This creates an amusing effect because its position in a sentence seems to make it apply to the wrong word . 
A verse familiar to all grammarians is the quatrain : `` I saw a man once beat his wife When on a drunken spree . 
Now can you tell me who was drunk -- The man , his wife , or me '' ? ? 
The `` wooden-leg '' gag of vaudeville , another standby of this sort , had endless variations . 
`` There's a man outside with a wooden leg named Smith '' . 
`` What's the name of his other leg '' ? ? 
Another stock vaudeville gag ran : `` Mother is home sick in bed with the doctor '' . 
When radio came in , it continued the misplaced modifier in its routines as a standard device . 
`` Do you see that pretty girl standing next to the car with slacks on '' ? ? 
`` I see the girl but I don't see the car with slacks on '' . 
In recent years gagwriters have discovered this brand of blunder and thus the misplaced modifier has acquired a new habitat in the gagline . 
In one cartoon a family is shown outside a theater with the head of the family addressing the doorman : `` Excuse me , but when we came out we found that we had left my daughter's handbag and my wife's behind '' . 
Journalism supplies us with an endless run of such slips . 
Not long ago a newspaper advised those taking part in a contest that `` snapshots must be of a person not larger than Af inches '' . 
Classified ads are also chockfull of misrelated constructions . 
Readers of the Reader's Digest are familiar with such items which often appear in its lists of verbal slips , like the ad in a California paper that advertised `` House for rent . 
View takes in five counties , two bedrooms '' . 
Since brevity is the soul of ambiguity as well as wit , newspaper headlines continually provide us with amusing samples . 
`` Officials Meet on rubbish . 
Many Shapes in bathtubs . 
Son and Daughter of Local Couple Married '' . 
Apart from misplaced modifiers and headlinese , journalism contributes a wide variety of comic ambiguities in both editorial and advertising matter . 
A weekly newspaper reported a local romance : `` and the couple were married last Saturday , thus ending a friendship which began in their schooldays '' . 
An item in the letters column of a newspaper renewed a subscription , adding : `` I personally enjoy your newspaper as much as my husband '' . 
Then there was the caterer's ad which read : `` are you getting married or having an affair ? ? 
We have complete facilities to accommodate 200 people '' . 
The newspaper too is the favorite habitat of the anatomical . 
This slip is so-called because its semi-ambiguous English always seems to refer to a person's anatomy but never quite means what it seems to say . 
Samples : He walked in upon her invitation . 
She kissed him passionately upon his reappearance . 
He kissed her back . 
Not without good reason has the anatomical been called jocular journalese . 
In news items a man is less often shot in the body or head than in the suburbs . 
`` While Henry Morgan was escorting Miss Vera Green from the church social last Saturday night , a savage dog attacked them and bit Mr. Morgan on the public square '' . 
Such items recall the California journalist who reported an accident involving a movie star : `` The area in which Miss N -- was injured is spectacularly scenic '' . 
The double meaning in the anatomical made it a familiar vaudeville device , as in the gags of Weber and Fields . 
When a witness at court was asked if he had been kicked in the ensuing rumpus , he replied , `` No , it was in the stomach '' . 
Strangely enough , this always brought the house down . 
Apart from journalese and vaudeville gags , the anatomical is also found in jocular literature . 
A conscientious girl became the secretary of a doctor . 
Her first day at work she was puzzled by an entry in the doctor's notes on an emergency case . 
It read : `` Shot in the lumbar region '' . 
After a moment of thought , her mind cleared and , in the interest of clarity , she typed into the record : `` Shot in the woods '' . 
There are many grammatical misconstructions other than dangling modifiers and anatomicals which permit two different interpretations . 
At the home of a gourmet the new maid was instructed in the fine points of serving . 
`` I want the fish served whole , with head and tail '' , the epicure explained , `` and serve it with lemon in mouth '' . 
The maid demurred . 
`` That's silly -- lemon in mouth '' , she said . 
But since the gourmet insisted that it is done that way at the most fashionable dinners , the girl reluctantly agreed . 
So she brought the fish in whole , and she carried a lemon in her mouth . 
Another specimen of such double-entendre is illustrated by a woman in a department store . 
She said to the saleslady , `` I want a dress to put on around the house '' . 
The puzzled saleslady inquired , `` How large is your house , Madam '' ? ? 
This saleslady was a failure in the dress department and was transferred to the shoe department . 
When a customer asked for alligator shoes , she said , `` What size is your alligator '' ? ? 
The comic indefinite comprises an extensive class of comedy . 
One species is restricted to statements which are neither explicit nor precise regarding a particular person , place , time or thing . 
A woman met a famous author at a literary tea . 
`` Oh , I'm so delighted to meet you '' , she gushed . 
`` It was only the other day that I saw something of yours , about something or other , in some magazine '' . 
This baffling lack of distinct details recalls the secretary whose employer was leaving the office and told her what to answer if anyone called in his absence . 
`` I may be back '' , he explained , `` and then again , I may not '' . 
The girl nodded understandingly . 
`` Yes , sir '' , she said , `` is that definite '' ? ? 
An old-fashioned mother said to her modern daughter , `` You must have gotten in quite late last night , dear . 
Where were you '' ? ? 
The daughter replied , `` Oh , I had dinner with -- well , you don't know him but he's awfully nice -- and we went to a couple of places -- I don't suppose you've heard of them -- and we finished up at a cute little night club -- I forget the name of it . 
Why , it's all right , isn't it , Mother '' ? ? 
Her woolly-minded parent agreed . 
`` Of course , dear '' , she said . 
`` It's only that I like to know where you go '' . 
No less ambiguous was the indefinity of a certain clergyman's sermon . 
`` Dearly beloved '' , he preached , `` unless you repent of your sins in a measure , and become converted to a degree , you will , I regret to say , be damned to a more or less extent '' . 
This clergyman should have referred to Shakespeare's dictum : `` So-so is a good , very good , very excellent maxim . 
And yet it is not . 
It is but so-so '' . 
Indefinite reference also carries double-meaning where an allusion to one person or thing seems to refer to another . 
A news item described the launching of a ship : `` Completing the ceremony , the beautiful movie star smashed a bottle of champagne over her stern as she slid gracefully down the ways into the sea '' . 
This is not unlike the order received by the sergeant of an army motor pool : `` Four trucks to Fort Mason gym , 7:30 tonight , for hauling girls to dance . 
The bodies must be cleaned and seats wiped off '' . 
A politician was approached by a man seeking the office of a minor public official who had just died . 
`` What are my chances for taking Joe's place '' ? ? 
He asked . 
`` If you can fix it up with the undertaker '' , returned the politician , `` it's all right with me '' . 
The manager of a movie theater received a telephone call from a woman who was equally indefinite . 
`` What have you got on today '' ? ? 
She inquired . 
`` A blue suit '' , he answered . 
`` Who's in it '' ? ? 
She continued . 
`` I am '' , he said . 
There was a short pause for reflection . 
`` Oh '' , said the woman , `` I've seen that picture already '' . 
Another brand of indefinite reference arises out of the use of the double verb . 
When a question contains two verbs , the response does not make clear which of them is being answered . 
The moonlit night was made for romance , and he had been looking at her soulfully for some time . 
Finally he asked , `` Do you object to petting '' ? ? 
`` That's one thing I've never done '' , she said promptly . 
He thought a moment , then inquired , `` You mean petted '' ? ? 
`` No '' , she smiled , `` objected '' . 
Replies to requests for character reference are notorious for their evasive double-entendre . 
It would be hard to find anything more equivocal than : `` I cannot recommend him too highly '' . 
Another less ambiguous case read as follows : `` The bearer of this letter has served me for two years to his complete satisfaction . 
If you are thinking of giving him a berth , be sure to make it a wide one '' . 
In the comedy of indefinite reference , it-wit occupies a prominent place because of its frequent occurrence . 
Ambiguity arises when the pronoun it carries a twofold reference . 
Two friends were talking . 
One said , `` When I get a cold I buy a bottle of whiskey for it , and within a few hours it's gone '' . 
The speaker referred to the whiskey but his friend thought he meant the cold . 
It-wit is a misnomer because it covers slips as well as wit . 
An excited woman was making an emergency call over the phone : `` Doctor , please come over right away . 
My husband is in great pain . 
I called the other afternoon on my old friend , Graves Moreland , the Anglo-American literary critic -- his mother was born in Ohio -- who lives alone in a fairy-tale cottage on the Upson Downs , raising hell and peacocks , the former only when the venerable gentleman becomes an angry old man about the state of literature or something else that is dwindling and diminishing , such as human stature , hope , and humor . 
My unscientific friend does not believe that human stature is measurable in terms of speed , momentum , weightlessness , or distance from earth , but is a matter of the development of the human mind . 
After Gagarin became the Greatest Man in the World , for a nation that does not believe in the cult of personality or in careerism , Moreland wrote me a letter in which he said : `` I am not interested in how long a bee can live in a vacuum , or how far it can fly . 
A bee's place is in the hive '' . 
`` I have come to talk with you about the future of humor and comedy '' , I told him , at which he started slightly , and then made us each a stiff drink , with a trembling hand . 
`` I seem to remember '' , he said , `` that in an interview ten years ago you gave humor and comedy five years to live . 
Did you go to their funeral '' ? ? 
`` I was wrong '' , I admitted . 
`` Comedy didn't die , it just went crazy . 
It has identified itself with the very tension and terror it once did so much to alleviate . 
We now have not only what has been called over here the comedy of menace but we also have horror jokes , magazines known as Horror Comics , and sick comedians . 
There are even publications called Sick and Mad . 
The Zeitgeist is not crazy as a loon or mad as a March hare ; ; 
it is manic as a man '' . 
`` I woke up this morning '' , Moreland said , `` paraphrasing Lewis Carroll . 
Do you want to hear the paraphrase '' ? ? 
`` Can I bear it '' ? ? 
I asked , taking a final gulp of my drink , and handing him the empty glass . 
`` Just barely '' , he said , and repeated his paraphrase : `` The time has come '' , the walrus said , `` To speak of manic things , Of shots and shouts , and sealing dooms Of commoners and kings '' . 
Moreland fixed us each another drink , and said , `` For God's sake , tell me something truly amusing '' . 
`` I'll try '' , I said , and sat for a moment thinking . 
`` Oh yes , the other day I reread some of Emerson's English Traits , and there was an anecdote about a group of English and Americans visiting Germany , more than a hundred years ago . 
In the railway station at Berlin , a uniformed attendant was chanting , ' Foreigners this way ! ! 
Foreigners this way ' ! ! 
One woman -- she could have been either English or American -- went up to him and said , ' But you are the foreigners ' '' . 
I took a deep breath and an even deeper swallow of my drink , and said , `` I admit that going back to Ralph Waldo Emerson for humor is like going to a modern musical comedy for music and comedy '' . 
`` What's the matter with the music '' ? ? 
Moreland asked . 
`` It doesn't drown out the dialogue '' , I explained . 
`` Let's talk about books '' , Moreland said . 
`` I am told that in America you have non-books by non-writers , brought out by non-publishers for non-readers . 
Is it all non-fiction '' ? ? 
`` There is non-fiction and non non-fiction '' , I said . 
`` Speaking of nonism : the other day , in a story about a sit-down demonstration , the Paris Herald Tribune wrote , ' The non-violence became noisier . 
And then Eichmann was quoted as saying , in non-English , that Hitler's plan to exterminate the Jews was nonsense '' . 
`` If we cannot tell evil , horror , and insanity from nonsense , what is the future of humor and comedy '' ? ? 
Moreland asked , grimly . 
`` Cryptic '' , I said . 
`` They require , for existence , a brave spirit and a high heart , and where do you find these ? ? 
In our present era of Science and Angst , the heart has been downgraded , to use one of our popular retrogressive verbs '' . 
`` I know what you mean '' , Moreland sighed . 
`` Last year your Tennessee Williams told our Dilys Powell , in a television program , that it is the task of the playwright to throw light into the dark corners of the human heart . 
Like almost everybody else , he confused the heart , both as organ and as symbol , with the disturbed psyche , the deranged glands , and the jumpy central nervous system . 
I'm not pleading for the heart that leaps up when it beholds a rainbow in the sky , or for the heart that with rapture fills and dances with the daffodils . 
The sentimental pure heart of Galahad is gone with the knightly years , but I still believe in the heart of the George Meredith character that was not made of the stuff that breaks '' . 
`` We no longer have Tom Moore's and Longfellow's ' heart for any fate ' , either '' , I said . 
`` Moore and Longfellow didn't have the fate that faces us '' , Moreland said . 
`` One day our species promises co-existence , and the next day it threatens co-extinction '' . 
We sat for a while drinking in silence . 
`` The heart '' , I said finally , `` is now either in the throat or the mouth or the stomach or the shoes . 
When it was worn in the breast , or even on the sleeve , we at least knew where it was '' . 
There was a long silence . 
`` You have visited England five times in the past quarter-century , I believe '' , my host said . 
`` What has impressed you most on your present visit '' ? ? 
`` I would say depressed , not impressed '' , I told him . 
`` I should say it is the turning of courts of law into veritable theatres for sex dramas , involving clergymen and parishioners , psychiatrists and patients . 
It is becoming harder and harder to tell law courts and political arenas from the modern theatre '' . 
`` Do you think we need a new Henry James to re-explore the Anglo-American scene '' ? ? 
He asked . 
`` Or perhaps a new Noel Coward '' ? ? 
`` But you must have heard it said that the drawing-room disappeared forever with the somnolent years of James and the antic heyday of Coward . 
I myself hear it said constantly -- in drawing-rooms . 
In them , there is usually a group of Anglo-Americans with tragicomic problems , worthy of being explored either in the novel or in the play or in comedy and satire '' . 
I stood up and began pacing . 
`` If you are trying to get us out of the brothel , the dustbin , the kitchen sink , and the tawdry living-room , you are probably wasting your time '' , Moreland told me . 
`` Too many of our writers seem to be interested only in creatures that crawl out of the woodwork or from under the rock '' . 
`` Furiouser and furiouser '' , I said . 
`` I am worried about the current meanings of the word funny . 
It now means ominous , as when one speaks of a funny sound in the motor ; ; 
disturbing , as when one says that a friend is acting funny ; ; 
and frightening , as when a wife tells the police that it is funny , but her husband hasn't been home for two days and nights '' . 
Moreland sat brooding for a full minute , during which I made each of us a new drink . 
He took his glass , clinked it against mine , and said , `` Toujours gai , what the hell '' ! ! 
Borrowing a line from Don Marquis' Mehitabel . 
`` Be careful of the word ' gay ' , for it , too , has undergone a change . 
It now means , in my country , homosexual '' , I said . 
`` Oh , I forgot to say that if one is taken to the funny house in the funny wagon , he is removed to a mental institution in an ambulance . 
Recently , by the way , I received a questionnaire in which I was asked whether or not I was non-institutionalized '' . 
My host went over and stared out the window at his peacocks ; ; 
then he turned to me . 
`` Is it true that you believe the other animals are saner than the human species '' ? ? 
`` Oh , that is demonstrable '' , I told him . 
`` Do you remember the woman in the French Alps who was all alone with her sheep one day when the sun darkened ominously ? ? 
She told the sheep , ' The world is coming to an end ' ! ! 
And the sheep said -- all in unison , I have no doubt -- ba-a-a ! ! 
The sound mockery of sheep is like the salubrious horse laugh '' . 
`` That is only partly non-nonsense '' , he began . 
`` If you saw the drama called Rhinoceros '' , I said , `` think of the effect it would have on an audience of rhinos when the actor on stage suddenly begins turning into a rhinoceros . 
The rhinos would panic , screaming help ! ! 
-- if that can be screamed in their language '' . 
`` You think the Russians are getting ahead of us in comedy '' ? ? 
Moreland demanded . 
`` Non-God , no '' , I said . 
`` The political and intellectual Left began fighting humor and comedy years ago , because they fear things they do not understand and cannot manage , such as satire and irony , such as humor and comedy . 
Nevertheless , like any other human being upon whom the spotlight of the world plays continually , Khrushchev , the anti-personality cultist , has become a comic actor , or thinks he has . 
In his famous meeting with Nixon a couple of years ago he seemed to believe that he was as funny as Ed Wynn . 
But , like Caesar , he has only one joke , so far as I can find out . 
It consists in saying , ' That would be sending the goat to look after the cabbage . 
Why in the name of his non-God doesn't he vary it a bit '' ? ? 
`` Such as '' ? ? 
Moreland asked . 
`` Such as ' sending the cat to guard the mice ' , or ' the falcon to protect the dove ' , or most terribly sharp of all , ' the human being to save humanity ' '' . 
`` You and I have fallen out of literature into politics '' , Moreland observed . 
`` What a nasty fall was there '' ! ! 
I said . 
Moreland went over to stare at his peacocks again , and then came back and sat down , restively . 
`` The world that was once foot-loose and fancy-free '' , he said , `` has now become screw-loose and frenzy-free . 
In our age of Science and Angst it seems to me more brave to stay on Earth and explore inner man than to fly far from the sphere of our sorrow and explore outer space '' . 
`` The human ego being what it is '' , I put in , `` science fiction has always assumed that the creatures on the planets of a thousand larger solar systems than ours must look like gigantic tube-nosed fruit bats . 
It seems to me that the first human being to reach one of these planets may well learn what it is to be a truly great and noble species '' . 
`` Now we are leaving humor and comedy behind again '' , Moreland protested . 
`` Not in the largest sense of the words '' , I said . 
`` The other day Arnold Toynbee spoke against the inveterate tendency of our species to believe in the uniqueness of its religions , its ideologies , and its virtually everything else . 
Why do we not realize that no ideology believes so much in itself as it disbelieves in something else ? ? 
Forty years ago an English writer , W. L. George , dealt with this subject in Eddies of the Day , and said , as an example , that ' Saint George for Merry England ' would not start a spirit half so quickly as ' Strike frog-eating Frenchmen dead ' '' ! ! 
`` There was also Gott strafe Angleterre '' , Moreland reminded me , `` and Carthago delenda est , or if you will , Deus strafe Carthage . 
It isn't what the ideologist believes in , but what he hates , that puts the world in jeopardy . 
This is the force , in our time and in every other time , that urges the paranoiac and the manic-depressive to become head of a state . 
Complete power not only corrupts but it also attracts the mad . 
There is a bitter satire for a future writer in that '' . 
`` Great satire has always been clearly written and readily understandable '' , I said . 
`` But we now find writers obsessed by the nooks and crannies of their ivory towers , and curiously devoted to the growing obscurity and complexity of poetry and non-poetry . 
I wrote a few years ago that one of the cardinal rules of writing is that the reader should be able to get some idea of what the story is about . 
One day , the children had wanted to get up onto General Burnside's horse . 
They wanted to see what his back felt like -- the General's . 
He looked so comfortable being straight . 
They wanted to touch the mystery . 
Arlene was boosting them up when the policeman came by . 
He was very rude . 
Arlene had a hard voice , too , this time . 
The policeman's eyes rather popped for a second ; ; 
but then Arlene got another tone in a hurry , and she said , `` If it wasn't for these dear children '' -- . 
The policeman got a confused , funny look on his face , and he had answered kind of politely , `` Now , look here , lady : I know you got to entertain these kids and all . 
But this is a public park and it's a city ordinance that the statues cannot be crawled on '' . 
Arlene was so ashamed that she hung her head when she said , `` Yes , sir '' . 
The policeman walked on , but he looked back once . 
That had happened on the day when two other unusual things had occurred . 
Arlene had taught them a new way to have fun in their little private area ; ; 
and they had told their mother about the tumbles . 
In matters of exact information , that kept her one step behind developments ; ; 
and so they were consistently true to their principles . 
`` Never mind '' , Arlene had said , after the policeman had left , having pursued the usual unco-operative course of grownups . 
`` Never mind . 
I know something that is much more fun that we can do on our little lawn '' . 
`` What is it '' ? ? 
Asked the children , whose reflexes and replies were invariably so admirably normal and predictable . 
Maybe that was why they were cordial and loyal towards the unpredictability of Arlene . 
`` Just you wait '' , advised Arlene , echoing the dialogue in a recent British movie . 
And when they had got to their little lawn , they had had a most twirlingly magnificent time . 
First , Arlene had put them through some rapid somersaults . 
They had protested that that wasn't any surprise . 
`` Just you wait '' , said Arlene again , as though she were discovering the pleasantly tingling insinuations of that handy little sturdy statement . 
`` This is a warm-up '' . 
`` Is it anything like cooked-over oatmeal '' ? ? 
Asked one of the children . 
`` Not the least bit '' , Arlene snapped . 
One of the many things that was so nice about her was that she always took your questions seriously , particularly your very , very serious questions . 
Those were especially the ones that all other grownups laughed at loudest . 
She would sometimes even get a little hard on you , she took you so seriously . 
But not hard for very long . 
Just long enough to make you feel important . 
`` Now '' , said Arlene , eventually , making them both sit in formation on a big root of a live oak , the sort of root that divided itself and made their bottoms sag down and feel comfortable . 
`` Now , we're going to be like what General Burnside and his horse make us think of '' . 
The children looked at each other and sagged their bottoms down even more comfortably than ever . 
Their curiosity went happily out of bounds . 
Then , Arlene threw herself backwards and wiggled in a way that was just wonderful . 
She held herself that way and turned her head towards them and laughed and winked . 
`` Imagine being able to laugh and wink when you're like the top part of that picture frame at home '' , one of them said . 
They both laughed and winked back . 
`` I'm General Burnside's horse , upside down '' , Arlene said , sort of gaspingly , for her : even she had to breathe kind of funny when she was in that position . 
She made General Burnside's horse's belly do so funny when it was upside down . 
Then , she was back on her feet , winking and smiling that enormous smile ( she had lots of wonderful big teeth that you never would have suspected she had when she was not smiling ) . 
And she would wink and throw kisses . 
They both tried to keep smiling and winking for a long time , but it made their lips and eyelids tremble . 
But they kept on clapping for a long , long time . 
`` This time '' , Arlene said , and she even kept on wiggling a little bit while she was just talking , `` you're going to tell me what I am and what I'm doing . 
It all has something to do with General Burnside and his horse '' . 
This time , it was so grand ;
