The bank said later that it was leaving its rate for special assistance funds from its second window unchanged at 16 pct , surprising operators who had expected an increase there too .

ABNORMAL RADIATION FOUND IN SOVIET TEA . 
Abnormally high levels of radiation were found in Soviet tea and hazelnuts more than nine months after the Chernobyl nuclear accident , West German residents in Moscow were advised this week . 
In a letter to the West German community here , Ambassador Joerg Kastl said laboratory tests on food samples bought in Moscow in February had shown elevated levels of caesium-134 and -137 in tea from Azerbaijan and Ukrainian hazelnuts . 
Other food samples sent for testing at Cologne University , including honey , fruit , vegetables , pork , milk and butter , were found to be free of radiation , it said . 
Data in the letter showed the tea and hazelnuts contained caesium levels far in excess of ceilings recommended by the United Nations Food and Agriculture Organisation -LRB- FAO -RRB- . 
The letter said people who had consumed the tea faced no particular health danger as most of the caesium remained in the tea leaves , but it warned against eating the hazelnuts . 
The products sent for testing were bought in state shops and private farmers ' markets in Moscow , it added . 
Other Western embassies in Moscow said they had discontinued laboratory testing of Soviet food late last year because no abnormal radiation levels were detected . 
`` We did n't find anything so we stopped doing it , '' a U.S. Embassy spokesman said . 
A British spokesman said radiation-monitoring equipment remained in the embassy waiting room for British residents in Moscow who wanted to check their food , but laboratory tests had not been conducted for several months . 
`` Earlier we sent some food back to Britain as a precautionary measure , but we stopped in the absence of any alarming signals , '' he said . 
`` If the tests had shown abnormal readings , they would have been resumed . ''

TIME < TL > 1987 EARNINGS MAY BE 4.25 DLRS SHARE . 
Time Inc 's chief financial officer , Thayer Bigelow , told security analysts the company is `` comfortable '' with Wall Street estimates that 1987 earnings will be in a range of 3.75 dlrs to 4.25 dlrs per share . 
In 1986 , Time reported earnings of 5.95 dlrs per share , including a number of special items . 
Bigelow said in adjusting the 1986 results for the special items and also removing the earnings of American Television and Communications Corp < ATCMA > , Time earned 2.35 dlrs per share in 1986 . 
Turner Broadcasting System Inc said the investment by the cable consortium would be in Turner Broadcasting , not directly in CNN . 
The consortium would infuse up to 550 mln dlrs in Turner Broadcasting in return for a 35 pct equity interest . 
Ted Turner , Chairman , would retain a 51 pct interest , a Turner Broadcasting spokesman said . 
Bigelow said the company is continuing its previously announced 10 mln share repurchase program and has bought back 4.1 mln of its own shares . 
He said 700,000 shares were purchased in the first quarter of 1987 at an average price of 81 dlrs per share . 
Bigelow said the company will always have a share buyback program in place whenever it believes it is a better long-term investment than starting or acquring a business . 
But he did not give any specifics on further repurchases beyond the 10 mln shares already announced . 
On the subject of acquisitions , Richard Munro , chairman and chief executive said the company is not interested in investing in over-the-air broadcasting , but continues to look at all areas in which it is currently engaged . 
Munro said book publishing is an area that interested Time . 
In 1986 the company purchased Scott and Foresman , its biggest acquisition ever . 
N.J. Nicholas , president and chief operating officer , said the company might be interested in a relatively small book business . 
He said following the recent agreement for the sale of Harper and Row to the News Corp Ltd < NWS > , `` there may be pieces that Murdoch does n't want , '' referring to News Corp chairman Rupert Murdoch . 
Asked if the company 's SAMI business is for sale , Munro said it is a `` delicate subject '' , and `` we 're looking at all the options . '' 
SAMI is a marketing information service for the food industry . 
Published reports have stated it could be worth as much as 500 mln dlrs . 
Bigelow said that Time 's Home Box Office added subscribers last year and the trend is continuing in the first quarter of 1987 . 
However , he said , HBO 's results in the quarter will be down slightly , but in the first quarter of 1986 there was a special gain in the HBO unit . 
Nicholas said that HBO and Cinemax had combined subscriber growth of 800,000 for last year . 
He also said the tax rate in 1987 will remain at just under 50 pct because of the repeal of investment tax credits and higher state and local taxes . 
He said he sees a decrease in the tax rate in 1988 of five or six percentage points . 
Munro said the company does not plan to increase its dividend . 
Trygve Myhren , chairman and chief executive of American Television and Communications , said the unit is looking at getting involved in the home shopping video area . 
`` It would be foolish not to be a player there , '' he said . 
He said the company had talks with Home Shopping Network Inc < HSN > prior to that company 's public offering last year , but nothing came of the talks .

GOODYEAR < GT > CHAIRMAN CRITICIZES CORPORATE RAIDS . 
The chairman of Goodyear Tire and Rubber Co , a concern that survived a recent hostile takeover bid , charged that `` terrorists in three-piece suits '' are undermining the nation 's industrial base . 
In a speech to a meeting of south Florida business executives , Goodyear Chairman Robert Mercer lashed out at corporate raiders and takeover specialists , accusing them of causing serious harm to the companies they target . 
`` Their interest is not in preserving and strengthening America 's industrial and providing jobs , '' he said . 
`` Their product is simply deals , and that is not a product which a country ... can base a future on . '' 
Last year , Mercer fought off a takeover attempt by British industrialist Sir James Goldsmith . 
But Goodyear 's independence was preserved at a high price , Mercer said . 
The company bought back Goldsmith 's stock for 620 mln dlrs , giving him a 93 mln dlr profit . 
Goodyear also paid him 37 mln dlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over two billion dlrs . 
In an effort to trim its new debt , Goodyear closed down three plants Mercer believes otherwise could have been saved , sold its motor wheel and aerospace units and reduced its payroll by 10 pct , he said . 
Mercer , who plans to testify tomorrow at a Senate hearing on a proposed bill to control corporate raiders , said hostile takeovers have also hurt workers . 
FED EXPECTED TO TAKE NO MONEY MARKET ACTION . 
The Federal Reserve is expected to take no reserve-management action in the U.S. Government securities market during its usual intervention period , economists said . 
They said that , if the Fed does act , it will likely add temporary reserves indirectly by arranging one to 1.5 billion dlrs of customer repurchase agreements . 
Federal funds , which averaged 6.14 pct yesterday , opened at 5-15 pct and remained there in early trading . 
Analysts believe this probably is about where the Fed wants the funds rate to be .

BP SAYS NO PLANS TO CLOSE SWEDISH REFINERY . 
The British Petroleum Co Plc < BP.L > said it had no plans to close its refinery in Gothenburg , despite forecasts by a Swedish finance ministry committee that it might be planning such a move . 
The committee said the refinery 's future looked bleak because the Swedish petroleum industry 's competitiveness was expected to worsen unless it invested , and because of the effects of a possible tightening of rules on sulphur content . 
But BP said the unit , in which Sweden 's < OK Petroleum AB > has a 22 pct stake , had performed well both technically and financially up to and including the first quarter of 1987 . 
Current restrictions on sulphur emissions and known future plans for both Sweden and export markets did not cause it any serious problems , it said in a statement . 
The refinery started up in 1967 and has an annual capacity of 4.7 mln tonnes . 
USDA CORRECTS TURKEY CREDIT ANNOUNCEMENT . 
The U.S. Agriculture Department said an announcement by the department yesterday concerning 15.0 mln dlrs in additional credit guarantees for exports of U.S. commodities to Turkey contained two inaccuracies . 
First , the USDA said its announcement should not have said that plywood was excluded from the additional three mln dlrs in GSM-102 credit guarantees for lumber . 
The original announcement said the guarantees included three mln dlrs for lumber , except plywood . 
Melvin Sims , USDA general sales manager , told Reuters he did not anticipate any plywood would be included in the sales , but that `` it 's possible it would be . '' 
Plywood in the past has not been eligible for GSM-102 credit guarantees because it is considered by some to be a manufactured product . 
Members states of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development have pledged not to offer concessional credits on manufactured products , Sims said . 
However , the Reagan administration is considering whether to allow plywood sales to be covered by the credit guarantee program , Sims said . 
Second , the USDA announcement said 6.0 mln dlrs of a previously announced 6.0-mln dlr line for tallow under GSM-102 was available for both public and private sector importers . 
In fact , the line of credit guarantees for tallow is available only for public sector importers , Walter Stern , Foreign Agricultural Service Turkey analyst , said . 
PLYWOOD CREDITS EYED BY REAGAN ADMINISTRATION . 
The Reagan administration is debating whether to provide government credit guarantees for the export of plywood , a U.S. Agriculture Department official said . 
As a member of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development , OECD , the United States has agreed not to provide any concessional credits on the export of manufactured products . 
However , USDA General Sales Manager Melvin Sims told Reuters the administration is considering allowing USDA to provide its first export credit guarantees for plywood on the grounds it is not a manufactured product . 
Sims said it was clear that wood products such as furniture , tables and window frames would be considered manufactured goods and therefore ineligible for export credit guarantees . 
However , the case of plywood was less clear . 
`` As long as it 's a basic material , we consider it still just a processed version of the basic agricultural commodity , '' Sims said in a telephone interview . 
Earlier today , USDA said that plywood was eligible under an export credit guarantee offer for Turkey announced yesterday . 
In its original announcement yesterday , USDA had said the offer included three mln dlrs for the export of lumber , excluding plywood . 
However , Sims said he did not expect any plywood exports to be including under the lumber guarantee offer . 
POPE AND TALBOT < POP > SEES HIGHER 1ST QTR NET . 
Pope and Talbot Inc said it expects first quarter earnings to total about one dlr per share , compared with a year-earlier loss of nine cts per share .

The wood products company also said it expects to release first quarter results later this month . 
MORE INTERMEDIATE U.S. WHEAT CREDITS FOR MOROCCO . 
The Commodity Credit Corporation has approved an additional 45.0 mln dlrs under its interemdiate export credit guarantee program , GSM-103 , for sales of U.S. wheat to Morocco , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . 
The action increases Morocco 's cumulative fiscal year 1987 program for wheat under GSM-103 to 75.0 mln dlrs . 
The credit terms extended for exports under the program must be in excess of three years but no more than seven years to eligible for credit coverage . 
All sales under this line must be registered and exported by September 30 , 1987 . 
The department also said the guarantee line for sales of U.S. wheat under the Export Credit Guarantee Program , GSM-102 , has been decreased 45.0 mln dlrs to 60.0 mln .

EC WHEAT RELEASE UNLIKELY TO SATISFY U.K. DEMAND . 
The European Commission 's decision to release an additional 300,000 tonnes of British intervention feed wheat for the home market will provide only moderate relief in an increasingly tight market , traders said . 
Some operators had been anticipating a larger tonnage , pointing out that at this week 's U.K. Intervention tender the market sought to buy 340,000 tonnes but only 126,000 tonnes were granted . 
The new tranche of intervention grain is unlikely to satisfy demand , they said , and keen buying competition for supplies in stores is expected to keep prices firm . 
The release of the feed wheat followed recent strong representations by the U.K. Grain trade to the Commission . 
There has been growing concern that rising internal prices , triggered by heavy exports , were creating areas of shortage in interior markets . 
The latest EC authorisation will add 70,000 tonnes at the April 14 tender and a further 30,000 tonnes later in the month . 
The remaining 200,000 tonnes will be made available in May and June . 
News of the release produced an early downward reaction in local physical markets , but by midday some sections had halved early two stg losses while others were unchanged . 
Ministry of Agriculture figures for March indicate 1.85 mln tonnes of wheat and 1.74 mln tonnes of barley remain in the free market . 
However , some traders believe these figures are overstated and , while some may still be held on the farm , the bulk of wheat is already sold . 
Some of the grain is also off the market in futures stores . 
A total of 2.10 mln tonnes of intervention wheat has been sold for export or to the home market since the season started July 1 , leaving an unsold balance in intervention of about 1.59 mln tonnes . 
Intervention barley sales have reached just over 1.0 mln tonnes , leaving about 753,000 tonnes , traders said . 
This season 's U.K. Export performance has surpassed all early expectations and has created the present nervous situation in domestic markets where the fear now is free market supplies may not last out until new crop becomes available in August . 
The market is sticking to its recent prediction of total barley and wheat exports of around 10.5 mln tonnes , a new record and nearly double the previous record of 5.9 mln tonnes achieved in the 1984 season . 
Traders expect U.K. Wheat exports to reach 6.0 mln and barley around 4.50 mln tonnes . 
The Soviet Union has booked a record total of 2.5 mln tonnes of British wheat and barley this season , but only 1.28 mln had surfaced in Customs export figures by March 25 , traders said . 
Other EC countries have bought large amounts of British grain and for the July 1 25 period had taken 2.59 mln tonnes of wheat and 2.06 mln tonnes of barley . 
This compares with 1.28 mln and 868,700 tonnes last season . 
The market is expecting prices , particularly wheat , to stay buoyant for the remaining few months of the season . 
If supplies become more difficult and prices strengthen further , feed compounders may increase cereal substitute usage , traders said .

It added that Portugal 's current account was forecast to show a surplus of 400 mln dlrs this year compared with 1.13 billion in 1986 and 369 mln the previous year . 
Last year 's high surplus was attributed to cheaper oil and raw materials , lower world interest rates and a weaker dollar . 
Imports by volume were forecast to grow 10 pct this year and exports four pct compared with increases of 16.5 pct and 6.6 pct respectively in 1986 , the bank said . 
The forecasts were calculated on the assumption that the non-expansionary monetary policy carried out by the current government would be maintained , particularly in budget spending and income and in wage policy . 
The bank added that the 1987 forecasts were also based on the assumption that the international economic situation and Portugal 's world trade relations would remain more or less the same as in 1986 . 
The central bank said the high rate of investment estimated for 1986 was due to government policies and to increasing optimism among firms whose financial situation had improved since 1985 . 
This tendency was expected to continue this year , especially in the construction and public works sectors . 
Financial aid from the EC had also helped to boost investment last year , the bank said . 
ASAMERA < ASM > TO FORM NEW MINING UNIT . 
Asamera Inc said it will transfer all its mineral interests into a new wholly owned subsidiary , Asamera Minerals Inc , which will later issue up to 15 pct of its shares to the public . 
The mineral interests will include Asamera 's 51 pct interest in the Cannon gold mine in Wenatchee , Wash. . 
Asamera said the mine produced 116,514 ounces of gold in 1986 and is expected to produce 130,000 to 140,000 ounces this year . 
Asamera said its talks with Breakwater Resources Ltd < BWRLF > on a possible merger of mining interests , including the Cannon mine , have been terminated . 
It did not elaborate . 
Asamera said holding all its mineral properties in a separate company will give better and more direct recognition to the value of the assets . 
Its other mining interests include gold exploration prospects on 13,000 acres in Inyo County , Calif. , and 500,000 acres in Canada 's Northwest Territories , the Gooseberry gold and silver mine in Nevada , chromite properties in northern California and Newfoundland , and a platinum prospect in the Rankin Inlet , Northwest Territories . 
OCCIDENTAL < OXY > UNIT SELLS DIVISION .

Terms were not disclosed . 
The division makes specialty industrial chemicals , it said . 
Later , industry sources said the division , which had worldwide sales of some 160 mln dlrs last year , was sold for just under 200 mln dlrs . 
SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE . 
Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter , weather and crop analysts said . 
Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point , but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems , analysts said . 
But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans , analysts of the Soviet Union said . 
`` From a weather standpoint , you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop -LRB- than last year -RRB- , '' Gail Martell , chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said . 
The next six weeks in the USSR 's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops , Martell and other analysts said . 
`` Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us , '' an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said . 
The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill . 
This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years , the USDA analyst said . 
With a timely spring , Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops , but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower . 
Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures . 
This winter , however , snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent , so the bulk of winterkill , analysts speculate , likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination . 
`` Fall dryness may be a problem . 
There 's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness , '' Martell said . 
Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine , and below normal over the entire winter crop area , she said . 
Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused problems of ice-crusting and winterkill , Jim Candor , senior forecaster for Accu Weather , said . 
Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter , analysts said . 
The dry fall damaged pastures , the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding , they said . 
`` The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they do n't have to buy -LRB- grains -RRB- now , '' a USDA official said . 
But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year 's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions , more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies , he said . 
Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market , weather analysts said . 
`` A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half , '' Martell said . 
NORANDA MINE SEEN BELOW FULL OUTPUT FOR MONTHS . 
Noranda Inc said production will remain shut down at its fire-damaged copper mine here until it can completely examine the mine . 
If it decides to keep the mine open it would take four or five months before it could resume full production . 
Company spokesman Dale Coffin said the investigation could take from a few days to several weeks but would not be more specific . 
Noranda said when it resumes production it plans to operate the mine at about one-third of the normal 72,000 tonnes annual finished capacity . 
The fire , which started Wednesday and burned itself out late yesterday weakened part of the mine 's support structure , Coffin said . 
One miner was killed and 56 others were trapped underground for about 24 hours before being brought safely out . 
U.K. FIRM UPS ITALY FUND < ITA > STAKE TO 12 PCT . 
Lloyds Investment Managers Ltd , a London-based investment firm , said it raised it stake in Italy Fund to 760,500 shares , or 12.0 pct of the total outstanding common stock , from 466,000 shares , or 7.4 pct . 
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Lloyds said it bought the additional 294,500 Italy Fund common shares since November 7 for a total of 3.3 mln dlrs . 
Another 70,000 shares of the stake are held by an affiliate , it said . 
It said its dealings in Italy Fund stock are for investment purposes only and that it has no current plans to increase or decrease its current stake . 
INVESTOR HAS FIVE PCT OF SAGE DRILLING < SAGE > .

Depending on several circumstances , Appleton said he may buy more Sage common shares , or sell some or all of his current stake .

COLECO INDUSTRIES < CLC > SEES PROFIT IN 1987 . 
Coleco Industries Inc said it expects to return to profitability in 1987 . 
Earlier , Coleco reported a net loss of 111.2 mln dlrs for the year ended December 31 compared to a profit of 64.2 mln dlrs in the year earlier . 
In a prepared statement , the company said the dramatic swing in operating results was due primarily to the steep decline in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids products from 600 mln dlrs to 230 mln dlrs . 
Coleco said it changed from a single product company to a more diversified organization through four major acquisitions last year . 
Products from the new acquisitions and other new product introductions are expected to enable it to return to profitability , it said . 
At the annual Toy Fair earlier this month , vice president Morton Handel said analysts ' 1987 projected earnings of 90 cts a share on sales of 600 mln dlrs are reasonable . 
ALCAN -LRB- AL -RRB- TO CLOSE WEST GERMAN SMELTER . 
-LRB- Alcan Aluminium Ltd -RRB- is closing its aluminum smelter in Ludwigshafen , West Germany this June due to high operating costs , an Alcan spokesman said . 
The smelter , near Frankfurt , had annual capacity of about 44,000 metric tons but was operating at about half that in January , spokesman Fernand Leclerc said . 
Leclerc said Alcan decided it would cost too much to modernize the plant . 
He said there is a possibility the company will sell the smelter , which currently employs 320 people , before its scheduled closing . 
NORANDA SETS TEMPORARY MINE SHUTDOWN .

UNION TO PROTEST DART 'S SUPERMARKETS < SGL > BID . 
The United Food And Commercial Workers said that more than 1,000 rank-and-file members of the union will demonstrate Monday at Dart Group Corp 's headquarters protesting Dart 's proposed 1.73 billion dlr takover of Supermarkets General < SGL > . 
Supermarkets is best known for its Pathmark chain of supermarket drug stores in the New York and New Jersey area and also owns Rickels home centers . 
The union said that it is firmly against the Dart bid because `` workers have always ended up with a raw deal in the current takeover mania . '' 
A Union statement said : `` We do not intend to allow our members to pick up the tab for Supermarket General 's executives and the bankers or the Dart Group who stand to make millions . '' 
Dart is controlled by the Haft family of Washington , which last year made a bid for California-based Safeway Stores Inc. . 
The Hafts lost , but walked away with at least 100 mln dlrs in profits , analysts estimate . 
The union said that Dart 's Safeway bid forced a major restructuring at Safeway to pay the Hafts and their lawyers and caused a loss of thousands of jobs . 
FCS LABORATORIES < FCSI > TERMINATES DEAL TALKS . 
FCS Laboratories Inc said merger discussions with an unnamed privately-held company in the health care field have ended without an agreement .

`` It 's disappointing to spend so much time on these negotiations and have them fail , '' said FCS chairman Nicholas Gallo III . 
`` But the discussions could not produce a deal acceptable to our board in the context of the company 's stronger financial position today as compared to six months ago . '' 
Gallo said FCS will stop actively seeking potential merger partners , but will respond to serious inquiries . 
`` We are determined to follow our plan to restore this company to profitability , '' he said . 
`` To continue actively searching for potential acquirers inherently forces us to postpone the implementation of critical decisions which are part of the plan . '' 
The company , which has 4,475,930 common shares outstanding , reaffirmed it expects to be profitable in the second half of the fiscal year ending September 30 , 1987 .

U.S. , JAPANESE OPEN TALKS ON SEMICONDUCTORS . 
U.S. and Japanese officials meet tomorrow to try to settle a dispute over semiconductor trade and to cut short the 300 mln dlr penalty tariffs President Reagan has ordered imposed on Japanese exports . 
But U.S. officials held out little hope that any accord could be reached before the tariffs of 100 per cent - up from about five per cent - are to take effect on April 17 . 
The Customs Bureau last week started to levy a bond on the Japanese goods that Reagan ordered penalized . 
The penalties would be retroactive to March 31 . 
Reagan said on March 27 when ordering the tariffs that he hoped the Japanese would soon end their unfair practices in semiconductor trade and that sanctions could be lifted . 
Technical meetings are to be held today and tomorrow , with meetings at a more senior level scheduled for Thursday and Friday . 
Public hearings on the sanctions are set for April 13 . 
The Japanese aides here for the technical talks include Shigeru Muraoka , director-general of international trade policy of the Ministry of International Trade and Industry -LRB- MITI -RRB- , and Masashi Yamamoto , deputy director-general of the information and machinery bureau . 
Meeting with them will Glen Fukushima , director of the Japan office of the U.S. Trade Representative 's Office , and Jim Gradoville , of trade representative 's office of industry and services . 
The two sides in the Thursday and Friday talks will be headed by Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and MITI vice minister Makoto Kuroda .

It said the rights are exercisable if a group acquires 20 pct or more of its common stock or announces a tender offer for 30 pct or more of its shares . 
FCS LABORATORIES < FCSI > ENDS MERGER TALKS .

UK MINISTER LOOKS TO EASE TENSION WITH JAPAN . 
The U.K. government hopes for a breakthrough on the deadlock with Japan over trade policies during next week 's visit to Tokyo by Corporate Affairs Minister Michael Howard , political sources said . 
Howard , who leaves for Japan tomorrow , told Reuters he will try to promote understanding on trade issues during his visit . 
Meanwhile , Britain will re-examine a letter from Japanese Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone promising personal help in solving the row over a U.K. firm 's bid to win a significant role in Japan 's telecommunications market , government sources said . 
Tensions have risen following Britain 's decision to arm itself early with new statutory powers which it says could be used against certain Japanese financial institutions . 
Britain reacted optimistically at first to the letter from Nakasone to Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , seeing it as a signal that he would work towards ensuring a satisfactory outcome to the bid launched by Cable and Wireless Plc , government officials said . 
But this view has since been clouded by reports from Tokyo that Nakasone 's assurances really constituted little more than politeness in the face of British anger , they added . 
CONABLE WARNS PROTECTIONISM MIGHT SPREAD . 
World Bank President Barber Conable expressed concern that trade protectionism , at the heart of a new showdown between the United States and Japan , might spread throughout the industrial world . 
But in an interview with Reuters , Conable said the action by the United States to slap tariffs on certain electronic goods from Japan did not mean the countries were heading for a full-scale trade war . 
Conable said the World Bank has been pressing developing countries to open their markets , arguing that a free trading environment increased the possibility of global economic growth . 
`` We have , in fact , been making adjustment loans to many countries in the developing world which have encouraged the opening of their markets and we want to be sure that the developed world does n't close at the same time , '' he said . 
He said the U.S. action against Japan was `` a significant retaliatory step but it did not constitute a basic change in trade policy . '' 
The interview came just before next week 's semi-annual meetings of the Bank and the International Monetary Fund . 
Referring to Brazil 's recent interest payments moratorium , Conable also said the global debt situation was very serious and must be closely watched . 
He said the Bank , which in the past has concentrated on making loans that assist the basic underpinnings in the developing world such as dams , roads and sewers , will increasingly make assistance available for economic reform . 
The Bank has increased these loans , in part because of the debt crisis that has found countries desperately in need of new funds for balance of payments adjustment and economic reforms aimed at opening their markets , encouraging foreign investment and reducing government 's role in the economy . 
`` We 're comfortable with adjustment lending , we expect , however , that it will never reach a majority of our portfolio , '' Conable said . 
He made clear , however , that adjustment lending would continue to increase as a proportion of overall Bank lending for some time . 
He noted , `` the problem of debt was a severe one and many countries are asking for adjustment assistance because of the problem of debt . '' 
Conable , is a a former Republican Congressman from New York chosen by President Reagan for the Bank position last year . 
He is an associate of Treasury Secertary James Baker who launched the U.S. strategy for shoring up indebted nations in October , 1985 which included a call for increased adjustment lending by the World Bank . 
Conable also said that he expected the result of a major study of the Bank 's organization to be completed in the next several weeks . 
He said the decision to seek a reorganization was based , in part , on the fact that the Bank had come under fire from the poorest countries for not doing enough to help and from the richest countries because of inefficiency . 
the reorganization is considered a major initiative by Conable , and is being closely-watched by the agency 's 151 member-countries as an indication of his management style and priorities . 
`` I want to be sure this institution is viewed by those who must support it as soundly constituted so that it will be permitted to grow , '' Conable said . 
However , he said `` I do n't believe there is anything basically wrong with this institution and I do n't believe it has to have any redefinition of its purpose . '' 
He said , however , that it was apparent that the debt initiative proposed by Baker has given the Bank a central role in dealing with the debt crisis . 
Conable added that cooperation between the Bank and its sister agency , the International Monetary Fund , was good and that he talked often with IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus on a variety of issues . 
On a personal level , Conable said that he not feel a need to put his personal stamp on the Bank noting that `` I do n't have a particular mission here except to be useful to the institution and to the process of development . '' 
He added , `` so I do n't feel a great calling to personalize the institution . '' 
On the development needs of sub-Sahara Africa , Conable said that the Bank was constantly reviewing new ways for assisting the region , noting that half of the recently agreed financing of 12.4 billion dlrs for Bank 's International Development Association was earmarked for Africa . 
Leading industrial nations are expected to consider new forms of debt relief for the very poorest nations , like those in the Sub-Sahara , during next week 's meetings . 
MINAS DE ALMADEN RAISES MERCURY PRICE . 
Spain 's Minas de Almaden y Arrayanes S.A. has agreed with Algerian producer ENOF to establish a minimum price of 300 dlrs per flask for spot mercury sales , Almaden spokesman Jesus Gallego said . 
In response to enquiries from Reuters , he said his company had raised the minimum price for its spot sales from 240 dlrs per flask following talks with ENOF . 
In a separate press release , the company said that ENOF and Almaden held talks in Istanbul a week ago with Turkish mercury producers on ways to improve prices , but Gallego said he was not in a position to say what action the Turkish companies would be taking . 
U.S. JOBS DATA SAID TO RULE OUT FED TIGHTENING . 
A steep drop in goods-producing jobs detracted from U.S. March non-farm payroll employment and makes it unlikely that the Federal Reserve will tighten monetary policy to defend the dollar , economists said . 
U.S. March non-farm payroll employment rose 164,000 , less than the gain of 220,000 to 290,000 the financial markets expected . 
Manufacturing employment fell 25,000 , compared with February 's 50,000 gain , while March construction employment dropped 45,000 after being unchanged in February . 
`` The momentum of industrial activity is tapering off as we end the first quarter , '' said Stephen Roach of Morgan Stanley and Co Inc. `` This sets the stage for more sluggish growth in the second and third quarters . '' 
`` The Fed will view this as a caution flag on the economy , '' he said . 
`` They will not ease as long the dollar is weak , but clearly they ca n't tighten . '' 
David Wyss of Data Resources Inc said that the downward revision in February non-farm payroll employment to 236,000 from 337,000 means that employment gains in the first quarter were weaker than expected . 
While Wyss left his first-quarter forecast of real U.S. gross national product growth at 3.5 pct , he said the March jobs data suggested a downward revision in his second-quarter growth forecast to 2.5 pct from 2.8 pct . 
Bill Sullivan of Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said the average monthly gain in non-farm jobs in the first quarter was only 237,000 , compared with 254,000 in the fourth quarter of 1986 . 
`` There 's momentum in first quarter labor force activity , but less than assumed , '' he said . 
`` Gains in goods-producing jobs were subdued at best . 
This rules out any possibilty of the Fed tightening for exchange-related purposes . '' 
In March , the average workweek fell back to its January level of 34.8 hours from 35.0 hours in February . 
Manufacturing hours also fell back to their January level , totalling 40.9 hours in March compared with 41.2 hours in February . 
The Commerce Department noted that loss of manufacturing jobs in March was concentrated in automobile , electrical and electronic manufacturing . 
Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities International said that a 13,000 decline in auto manufacturing employment accounted for nearly half of the total drop in manufacturing jobs . 
Economists said that a build-up in auto inventories resulting from a steep drop in sales has finally caught up with the labor force and may point to slower growth ahead . 
Most expect an increase in inventories of as much as five pct to offset a steep four to five pct drop in final sales in the first-quarter GNP accounts . 
Roach said he expects first quarter U.S. GNP to rise two pct , to be followed by a gain of 1.0-1 .5 pct at best in the second and third quarters . 
He said the March drop in industrial activity `` is a reasonable response in light of the inordinate contribution inventory accumulation made to GNP . '' 
Economists said the employment data also suggest weak gains in industrial production and personal income for March . 
They expect only marginal gains , if not small declines , for these indicators , compared with a February increases of 0.5 pct in industrial production and 0.9 pct in personal income . 
Steve Slifer of Lehman Government Securities said the drop in March construction employment may also signal a drop in March housing starts , which rose 2.6 pct in February to 1.851 million units at an annual rate from 1.804 million units in January . 
The rate of unemployment fell to 6.6 pct , its lowest level since March 1980 , from 6.7 pct in February . 
But Wyss pointed out that this resulted from a drop in the labor force , which fell to 119.2 mln in March from 119.35 mln in February . 
`` This just means that there were fewer people looking for work , so the drop in unemployment does n't mean much , '' he said . 
He said the latest employment report will not concern the Fed because it does points to GNP growth in the first half of 2.5-3 .0 pct , but `` it does suggest they ca n't afford to tighten to quickly either . '' 
The statistical factors used to smooth out seasonal fluctuations in the jobs data may have understated March labor force gains , just as seasonal factors probably overstated them in January and February , Slifer said , but are consistent with his forecast of 1.8 pct first quarter GNP growth . 
Economic growth remains sluggish , but Silfer does not think that the Federal Open Market Committee changed policy at their meeting this week . 
`` At some point they will be more inclined to ease , '' he said . 
For the time being , however , the March employment report `` increases the likelihood they wo n't tighten , regardless of the dollar . ''

OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT . 
Crude oil prices rallied today , moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia 's determined effort to support prices , analysts said . 
`` The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market , hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting , '' said Sanford Margoshes , oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc. . 
`` But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating , '' he added . 
Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december . 
The analysts said that to get others to hold the line , Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers ' meeting the previous week . 
The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil , analysts said . 
`` They are trying to make sure that no one discounts , and to prevent that , it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales , '' Margoshes said . 
He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales . 
Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar , which has had trouble selling oil . 
But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts . 
Analysts said that Saudi Arabia , with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman , was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart . 
Daniel McKinley , oil analyst with Smith Barney , Upham Harris and Co said , `` both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally . '' 
He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo , which refused discounts to Japanese buyers , brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions . 
Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai , which sent prices up on Mideast sours , with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market . 
Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments . 
North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs , up one dlr . 
OPEC members ' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions . 
Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level . 
`` The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result , '' Margoshes said . 
Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally . 
Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount . 
But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors , including demand , which could cut the rally short . 
Marion Stewart , an indepedent petroleum economist , said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986 . 
BELL PETROLEUM < BPSIO > , REGAL TO FORM PLAN .

SEC CLARIFIES POSITION ON TENDER OFFER CHANGES . 
The Securities and Exchange Commission reminded corporate raiders and others tendering for the shares of companies that they must extend the period their offers are open if key conditions are changed . 
Specifically , the agency said those making tender offers for companies ' stock must extend the offers if they decide to eliminate conditions requiring a minimum number of shares to be tendered in order for the offers to be valid . 
Tender offers typically include minimum share conditions . 
As a result , a purchaser would not be bound to buy the shares that were tendered if the minimum level were not reached . 
In an interpretation of current rules , which officials said clarifies the SEC 's present position , the agency said a tender offer must be extended if a minimum share condition is waived , even if the purchaser reserved the right to do so . 
The interpretation makes clear that waiving a minimum share condition is a `` material change '' of the tender offer under U.S. securities law , SEC officials said . 
The SEC has already said that other specific material changes , such as changes in the percentage of securities being sought or the price being offered , made during the course of a tender offer require a 10-day extension of the offer . 
The length of the extension , which is aimed at giving shareholders an adequate chance to assess revisions of a tender offer , was not specified in cases where the minimum share conditions were waived . 
SEC officials said the length of the extension in such cases would depend on the facts and circumstances surrounding each case , but would generally be between five and 10 days . 
The agency cited two recent tender offers in which waivers of a minimum share conditios were tried on the last day of each offer , denying shareholders the chance to react to the new information . 
Officials declined to identify the two offers . 
`` If a bidder makes a material change near or at the end of its offer , it will have to extend the offer to permit adequate dissemination , '' the SEC said . 
Federal securities law requires that all tender offers remain open for at least 20 business days .

U.S. SCIENTISTS SAY TROPICAL OILS HEALTH RISK . 
U.S. scientists said some tropical vegetable oils can be hazardous to consumers whose health is at risk because of high levels of saturated fat , lending weight to a campaign by the American Soybean Association -LRB- ASA -RRB- for labelling changes . 
The scientists appeared to support an ASA charge , denied by Malaysian palm growers , that imported coconut , palm and palm kernel oils contain high levels of saturated fat and thus raise blood cholesterol and the risk of heart disease . 
In a petition filed in January , the ASA asked the U.S. Food and Drug Administration -LRB- FDA -RRB- to require palm , palm kernel and coconut oils to be identified as saturated fats on food manufacturers ' labels . 
The FDA responded to the ASA in a letter saying it would consider the petition as a comment to a proposed rule dealing with cholesterol and fatty acid labelling of foods . 
Malaysian oil palm growers have said the charges by the ASA that palm oil consumption increases blood cholesterol and contributes to heart disease are untrue . 
But Steve Chang , Professor of Food Science at Rutgers University , said , `` Palm oil is definitely not good for human health because it has a high content of saturated fatty acid . '' 
He added that the higher the fatty acid , the greater the blood cholesterol level . 
`` It has been well established that high cholesterol levels will have a higher level of heart disease , '' he said . 
A Malaysian Oil Palm Growers Council official , Borge Bek-Nielsen , has said studies have shown that palm oil is cholesterol-free , low in saturated fats , has anti-cancer properties and prevents blood clotting and blocking of arteries in humans . 
Bek-Nielsen said Americans consume more saturated fats daily through food like butter , bacon , ham and beef than from palm oil , which , he added is rich in vitamins A and E. David Kritchevsky , Associate Director of the Wistar Institute in Philadelphia , appeared to take the ASA view on labelling . 
`` What people really have to learn is to read labels , '' said Kritchevsky . 
`` The more a consumer knows , the more likely he will make an intelligent choice . '' 
The U.S. scientists said they had no doubt imported palm , palm kernel and coconut oils contain high saturated fat levels . 
Kritchevsky , a specialist in nutrition , said , `` More saturated fat would raise cholesterol levels ... So , from that point of view it 's a health risk . 
High cholesterol levels in the blood are a risk factor for heart disease . '' 
Susanne Harris , deputy assistant secretary of the U.S. Agriculture Department 's Food and Consumer Services Division , said the health risk among consumers of vegetable oils with high saturated fat levels was highest among those who have heart disease . 
The scientists said more than 50 pct of the fatty acid content of the tropical oils was saturated , whereas less than 20 pct of the fatty acid content of soybean oil was saturated . 
David Ericksen , director of ASA 's technical services , said U.S. soybean producers could regain about one-half of the 273 mln dlrs in sales lost to imported tropical oils if consumers were aware the vegetable oils were high in saturated fat . 
Imported tropical oils displace 171 mln bushels of U.S. soybean sales in the U.S. market , ASA estimates . 
U.S. imports of coconut oil during January totaled 82.9 mln lbs compared with 48.0 mln lbs in December and 106.5 mln a year earlier , according to Commerce Department figures . 
Imports of palm oil totaled 44.0 mln lbs compared with 51.3 mln lbs in December and 85.2 mln a year earlier . 
SNYDER < SOI > MAKES CENERGY < CRG > EXCHANGE OFFER . 
Snyder Oil Partners L.P. told the Securities and Exchange Commission it made an exchange offer to Cenergy Corp that would allow Snyder to acquire up to 49.9 pct of the company 's common stock . 
Under the exchange offer , which was proposed yesterday to Cenergy 's officers and directors , each share of Cenergy common stock could be exchanged for 8.50 dlrs in market value of Snyder 's limited partnership units , Snyder said . 
Under the proposal , Snyder , which already holds 1,170,400 Cenergy common shares , or 12.0 pct of the total , could boost its Cenergy stake to a total of 49.9 pct , it said . 
Snyder did not say whether it has received any response to its proposal from Cenergy . 
If it acquires the 49.9 pct stake , Snyder said in its SEC filing it would use the stock to `` obtain a proportionate beneficial interest '' in the company 's assets and liabilities . 
It said it has not decided its next move it the exchange proposal does not lead to negotiations with Cenergy . 
Snyder said it may boost its stake or sell some or all of its current holdings . 
It repeated a statement made in its initial SEC filing last month that it is considering several alternatives , including seeking control of Cenergy .

CANADA OIL INDUSTRY SET FOR RECOVERY - ANALYSTS . 
Firmer crude oil prices , government aid packages and corporate spending cuts will help Canada 's oil industry recover from last year sharp downturn , industry analysts said . 
They said there will be significant earnings gains in 1987 compared to last year 's dismal results when oil prices dropped about 50 pct . 
On Canada 's stock exchanges , energy shares have soared to their highest levels since 1983 , with many issues trading at record highs . 
`` This is reflecting a tremendous amount of optimism on the part of the investment community that the outlook for the industry for the future is extremely attractive , '' Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert said . 
Financial statements from Canada 's major oil companies , culminating with Dome Petroleum Ltd 's 2.20 billion Canadian dlr 1986 loss reported this week , painted a bleak picture of last year 's results , analysts said . 
`` But the financial statements are a snap shot and a recording of history . 
The stock market is the indication of the future , '' Gobert commented . 
The Toronto Stock Exchange 's oil and gas index of 41 companies is up to 4065.4 so far in trading today from 3053.15 at the end of 1986 . 
Among Canada 's largest oil companies , class A shares of Imperial Oil Ltd < IMO.A > , 70 pct owned by Exxon Corp < XON > , is trading at 71 , up from a 52-week low of 34-3 . 
Shell Canada Ltd , 72 pct owned by Royal Dutch Group , is at 40-1 , up from a low during the last year of 18-3 . 
Texaco Canada Inc < TXC > , 78 pct owned by Texaco Inc < TX > , is at 34-7 , up from a low of 24-1 . 
Levesque Beaubien Inc oil analyst Robert Plexman forecasts operating profit for 10 of Canada 's largest oil and gas companies will rise 37 pct in 1987 to about 1.44 billion dlrs and operating cash flow will increase 12 pct to 3.24 billion dlrs , based on an average oil price for the year of 16.50 U.S. dlrs a barrel . 
`` However , if prices hold about 18 U.S. dlrs a barrel ... 1987 net operating income could show a 69 pct increase with cash flow 27 pct higher , '' analyst Plexman said . 
`` Although it is difficult to forecast the extent of the profit improvement this year , the gain should be significant , '' he added . 
Those improvements follow a sharp downturn in 1986 , when operating income for the ten companies dropped 47 pct to 1.05 billion dlrs and operating cash flow fell 22 pct to 2.90 billion dlrs . 
But one industry source does n't think oil prices will hold recent gains and more government assistance is needed . 
Canadian Petroleum Association technical director Hans Maciej sees industry cash flow falling another 10 pct in 1987 , after dipping about 60 pct last year . 
Maciej said he sees crude oil supply outweighing demand and does n't believe a recent OPEC production accord will continue to support prices . 
However , several companies share the optimistic industry outlook expressed by a majority of analysts . 
Shell Canada and < Norcen Energy Resources Ltd > forecast improved 1987 earnings in their annual reports issued this week , assuming oil prices remain at or above 1986 levels . 
`` The industry 's outlook for 1987 is positive , but not robust , '' Texaco Canada said in its annual report . 
`` While oil prices have strengthened somewhat and there is good reason to believe that the general level is sustainable , continued volatility is likely , '' Texaco Canada added . 
In the face of short-term uncertainty , many companies have pared 1987 spending plans from last year 's lower levels , deferring most frontier exploration work . 
`` The industry is becoming very selective in investments , very conservative and cautious , which is not unexpected , '' Canadian Petroleum Association 's Maciej said . 
Federal and Alberta goverment aid measures helped cushion the industry downturn in 1986 and are improving 1987 results . 
The most significant help came last September when the federal government lifted the 10 pct Petroleum Gas Revenue Tax -LRB- PGRT -RRB- 28 months earlier then planned . 
Analysts estimate the tax relief will save larger oil companies about 1.50 billion dlrs by the end of 1988 . 
The PGRT cut helped brake the steep profit and cash flow decline in 1986 for many oil companies and prevented further exploration spending cuts , analysts said . 
`` For a number of companies , the PGRT cut was absolutely necessary to even maintain the kind of reduced investments that were made , otherwise the reduction would have been considerably more , '' Maciej said . 
U.S. GOLD PRODUCTION ROSE IN DECEMBER . 
U.S. mine production of gold rose to 244,900 troy ounces in December from 244,749 ounces in November , the U.S. Interior Department 's Bureau of Mines said . 
U.S. imports of gold in December were 692,700 ounces , vs 2,011,754 ounces in November and 611,811 ounces in December , 1985 .

COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS . 
Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas , ICO delegates and traders said . 
The failure last night of International Coffee Organization , ICO , producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-1 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg , down 184 stg from the previous close . 
The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb . 
Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices , some senior traders said . 
The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2 . 
This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop . 
In a Reuter interview , Brazilian Coffee Institute , IBC , President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions . 
`` If we have failed at the ICO , at least we have tried , '' Dauster said , adding `` now it is time to go and sell coffee . '' 
But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open . 
It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month , Dauster said . 
It is too difficult to forecast now . 
Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln . 
Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London 's futures market last year . 
A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market `` in one go '' but is sold over a minimum of six months . 
The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas . 
Consumers said `` objective criteria '' like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares , Dauster said . 
All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the `` ad hoc '' way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO . 
Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings . 
It is a `` simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate '' policy to other producers . 
While consumer countries are welcome to participate they can not dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different `` objective criteria '' achieve different share-outs of quota , Dauster said . 
Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise . 
Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers ' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them . 
`` We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage , '' one delegate said . 
Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed . 
The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then . 
The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September . 
More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine . 
In that case quotas could come into force during the summer . 
But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely , while Brazil 's Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980 . 
A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now . 
At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability . 
In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found . 
`` Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now , '' one consumer said .

LOWER U.S. RICE STOCKS , STRONG EXPORTS - USDA . 
Rising demand for U.S. rice may gradually reduce surpluses while a marketing loan should help increase the U.S. share of the world rice market despite sluggish trade this year , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . 
In its quarterly rice outlook and situation summary , the department said U.S. rice use may surpass production during the 1986 marketing year , causing stocks to fall about 10 mln hundredweight from a year earlier to an estimated 67 mln cwt on July 31 . 
Long grain acreage as a percentage of total acreage is expected to decline this year , the report said . 
USDA said factors once supportive of increased long grain acreage have turned around . 
Domestic prices of medium grain relative to long grain have increased , the loan differential has been greatly reduced and increases in long grain yields relative to those of other classes have leveled off . 
With the drop in domestic prices resulting from the marketing loan , domestic rice use is expected to grow at a faster rate , USDA said . 
`` Development of new products and increased promotion have helped make rice more available and visible to a wider range of consumers , '' USDA said . 
USDA said world trade is expected to fall in 1987 because of large production and stocks but a weaker market should affect competing exporters more than the U.S. `` The United States has already recovered a substantial share of the European Community market and made inroads into markets in the Middle East and Africa , '' the report said . 
World rice consumption is projected to reach record levels in 1986 , the report said , as higher per capita incomes , increased domestic production and low import prices have allowed people in many countries to substitute rice for coarse grains . 
China , India and South Korea have increased output , while the Middle East and Africa have doubled imports since the mid-1970s , the report said . 
HUTTON < EFH > STILL INTERESTED IN PUROLATOR < PCC > . 
E.F. Hutton LBO Inc is still interested in an acquisition of Purolator Courier Corp , and is examining the possibility of raising its 35 dlr per share offer , an E.F. Hutton spokesman said . 
Hutton 's offer was topped by a 40 dlr per share offer from Emery Air Freight Corp < EAF > earlier this week . 
`` We 're definately not out of it at this point , '' the Hutton spokesman said . 
`` We want to see what the offer is completely and understand it fully , and then fashion our response , '' the spokesman said . 
After Emery made its offer , Hutton extended the deadline on its offer to Monday . 
The offer was to have expired Wednesday . 
Analysts said it might be difficult for Hutton to raise the offer since Emery , an overnight courier , might have an easier time justifying a lofty price since it would realize cost savings by combining its business with those of Purolator . 
Purolator , a New Jersey-based overnight courier , has declined comment . 
Purolator had traded above the Hutton offer price on speculation a new bidder would emerge . 
It was up 1 today at 40-3 , above the Emery offer .

INTERNATIONAL LPG PRICES MIXED . 
International LPG prices were mixed in the past week , with North Sea prices easier while prices in the Mediterranean and the Gulf were up in April , traders said . 
In the North Sea market , small cargoes of propane were sold as high as 126 dlrs per tonne on the f.o.b. basis early in the week , but prices eased after the majors posted their April contract prices , traders said . 
British Petroleum plc < BP > left propane unchanged at 110 dlrs and raised butane prices 5.50 dlrs to 123 dlrs , Shell , a unit of Royal Dutch Group < RD > < ST > raised propane three dlrs to 113 and butane 5.50 dlrs to 123 dlrs , they said . 
In the Mediterranean , prices firm in Lavera as Algerian supplies were not always available . 
Spot propane was unchanged , while butane rose about 25 dlrs from last week , traders said . 
They said , however , the Mediterranean butane market was very thin , making it subject to wide price swings . 
In the Gulf , strong demand from the Far East pushed premium on small cargoes five to 10 dlrs above government selling price -LRB- gsp -RRB- for propane and 10 dlrs for butane , traders said . 
The rising premium over gsp , however , was partially offset by about 10 pct decline in shipping , making prices for propane about unchanged and butane five dlrs higher , basis c. and f. Japan , the traders said .

U.S. MEAT PROCESSORS ASK FOR LABELLING CHANGE . 
Four U.S. meat processors have asked the federal government to relax a labelling requirement which they said discourages the use of mechanically separated meat , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . 
The petition , filed by Bob Evans Farms , Odom Sausage Co , Sara Lee Corp and Owens Country Sausage , asks USDA to allow mechanically separated meat to be listed on product labels as the species from which it was derived . 
For example , `` pork '' would be listed on the ingredients statement instead of `` mechanically separated pork . '' 
Under the petition , the calcium content of the meat product would have to be stated on the label and the mechanically separated meat could constitute no more than 10 pct of the meat and poultry portion of the product . 
Mechanically separated meat is a high-protein , low-cost product that has been approved for use since 1978 , USDA said . 
Current regulations allow use of mechanically separated ingredients at levels up to 20 pct of the meat and poultry product , but require it to be listed in the ingredient statement as `` mechanically separated -LRB- species -RRB- , '' USDA said . 
USDA said the petitioning firms claimed companies avoid using mechanically separated meat in their products because the term carries an `` unwarranted negative connotation '' in the minds of many consumers . 
The petitioners also noted that no similar regulation exists for poultry products . 
Mechanically separated meat is made by placing carcass parts , which usually have been hand-trimmed but still have some remaining meat , into specialized processing equipment .

FEBRUARY FOMC VOTES UNCHANGED MONETARY POLICY . 
The Federal Open Market Committee at its February 10-11 meeting voted nine to one to maintain the then-existing degree of reserve restraint , minutes showed . 
The FOMC issued an asymmetric inter-meeting policy directive which gave greater possibility to firmer rather than easier policy . 
The Committee set a six to seven pct January through March annualized growth target for M-2 and M-3 and no M-1 goal . 
At the prior meeting in mid-December , the FOMC set a seven pct target for M-2 and M-3 for November through March . 
The February FOMC kept the four to eight pct Federal funds rate `` reference '' range for policy , as in other recent meetings . 
At a telephone conference on February 23 , committee members discussed the possible implications of the decisions reached in Paris for U.S. intervention in foreign exchange markets . 
No conclusions were contained in the minutes . 
In its inter-meeting policy directive , the February FOMC said that `` somewhat greater reserve restraint would , or slightly lesser reserve restraint might , be acceptable depending on the behavior of the aggregates , taking into account the strength of the business expansion , developments in foreign exchange markets , progress against inflation , and conditions in domestic and international credit markets . '' 
The February FOMC voted nine to one for an unchanged policy . 
Thomas Melzer , St Louis Federal Reserve Bank president favored some tightening of reserve conditions . 
He noted the strong growth in bank loans in November through January and the firm federal funds rate that had prevailed despite the extraordinary pace of reserve growth . 
He also cited the recent declines in the dollar 's value . 
Finally , looking ahead , Melzer pointed out the potential for a further rise in inflationary expectations . 
He believed that prompt restraints might avert the need for more substantial tightening later . 
Regarding inter-meeting policy adjustments , the FOMC minutes showed , `` the members generally felt that policy implementation should be especially alert to the potential need for some firming of reserve conditions . '' 
In this view , the FOMC said somewhat greater reserve restraint would be warranted if monetary growth did not slow in line with current expectations and there were concurrent indications of intensifying inflationary pressures against the background of stronger economic data . 
One indication of potential price pressure might be a further tendency for the dollar to weaken . 
The minutes showed that one member , presumably Melzer , preferred a directive that did not contemplate any easing during the weeks ahead . 
However , `` most of the members did not want to rule out the possibility of some slight easing during the inter-meeting period , although they did not view the conditions for such a move as likely to emerge . '' 
The FOMC members assumed that future fluctuations in the dollar 's value would not be of sufficient magnitude to have any significant effect on the Fed 's economic projections . 
In addition , they anticipated that considerable progress would be made in reducing the federal budget deficit .

U.S. DEFENDS STOCKPILED TIN SALES IN 1986 . 
The United States defended its sales of stockpiled tin in 1986 in reaction to criticism from Malaysian miners who have said it violated an agreement with southeast Asian producers . 
`` The United States has continued to abide by the spirit of the memorandum of understanding and has consulted with the ASEAN states on GSA tin disposals , '' a State Department spokesman said in a statement . 
`` The views of the ASEAN governments have been taken into account in determining disposal levels , '' the statement said . 
The United States and the ASEAN countries signed a memorandum of understanding concerning tin disposals by the U.S. General Services Administration -LRB- GSA -RRB- in December 1983 . 
In its latest annual report , the States of Malaya Chamber of Mines said the GSA sold 5,490 tonnes of tin in 1986 , well above an agreed upon annual limit of 3,000 tonnes . 
`` The United States appears to have lost sight of the U.S.  ASEAN Memorandum of Understanding , '' it said . 
The State Department statement said GSA tin disposals increased in calendar year 1986 due to changed market conditions . 
During the first quarter of calendar year 1987 , they have been running at a lower rate compared to 1986 . 
The spokesman declined to say how much stockpiled tin the GSA sold last year , however .

He said Scott , Foresman , a textbook publisher , will contribute more than 50 mln dlrs in operating income before depreciation and amortization for the full year . 
N.J. Nicholas , president and chief operating officer , said Soctt Foresman will have over 200 mln dlrs in revenue in 1987 . 
Bigelow said the textbook business , which normally has its highest profit in the third quarter and incurs a loss in the first quarter , will have an `` adverse impact of 15 mln dlrs ' on book publishing income for the first quarter . 
`` First quarter performance for the rest of Time Inc will be better than last year , '' Bigelow said . 
The dilution of 17 cts per share for 1987 includes the effects of financing the acquisition . 
Bigelow also said the company is `` comfortable '' with estimates that earnings will be between 3.75 dlrs and 4.25 dlrs per share for the year .

Regarding the company 's shareholders meeting Tuesday , Gabelli told Reuters , `` there was nothing said that caused me to sell or buy . '' 
He still thinks `` values are 140 dlrs per share or more '' and has clients that asked to buy more .

GULF STATES -LRB- GSU -RRB- SEES END TO CASH BY MAY . 
Gulf States Utilities Co said its condition has `` significantly deteriorated '' and that its operating cash reserves will be inadequate by May 1987 unless it receives additional financing or rate relief from state public utilities commissions in Texas and Louisiana . 
In the company 's newly-released annual report and 10-K filing , Gulf States said its bank lenders had notified the utility last month that no additional credit would be granted . 
Gulf States said the banks had requested the utility to begin making prepayments by the end of April of 45 mln dlrs more than the estimated 1987 lease payments of 40 mln dlrs . 
`` The circumstances increase the likelihood that the company may have to seek protection from its creditors under the bankruptcy code , '' Gulf States said . 
The utility had previously said it might be forced to consider filing for bankruptcy because of limited rate increases granted by state regulators in connection with Gulf States ' 4.3 billion dlr River Bend nuclear plant in Louisiana . 
`` If the regulatory commissions approve the company 's proposed rate moderation plan and grant the increases provided for in such plan during the initial three-year phase-in period , the company believes it could achieve financial stability , '' Gulf States said . 
In February , the Texas Public Utilities Commission granted Gulf States an interim rate increase of 39.9 mln dlrs contingent upon the utility obtaining a new 250 mln dlr line of credit to pay operating expenses . 
The utility had sought 144.1 mln dlrs in rate hikes in Texas . 
Gulf States has appealed a decision by Louisiana state regulators rejecting its application for 100 mln dlrs in emergency rate relief . 
In 1986 , Gulf States earned 244.9 mln dlrs on revenues of 1.47 billion dlrs , compared to profits of 265.4 mln dlrs on sales of 1.85 billion in the previous year .

INSTITUTE SEES W.GERMAN OUTPUT FALL IN 1987 . 
Production in the manufactured goods industry has been falling since mid-1986 and will decline by between one and two pct this year after a 2.5 pct increase in 1986 , the Ifo economic institute said . 
An Ifo report said recessionary influences were affecting the engineering industry particularly . 
It saw a decline of two to three pct in this sector after a 5.2 pct rise in 1986 . 
Orders , especially from abroad , were also falling sharply for capital goods in the electronics sector , it added . 
Ifo also predicted stagnation in the automobile industry in 1987 after a particularly successful 1986 when production rose 5.1 pct . 
Chemical industry production , which fell by 0.9 pct last year , was likely to stagnate or decline by one pct in 1987 . 
This sector suffered from slack demand from abroad and from low domestic consumption .

LAWSON SAYS U.K. ELECTION NOT ONLY EMS BAR . 
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson said the next U.K. Election was not the only element standing in the way of full British membership of the European Monetary System -LRB- EMS -RRB- . 
But he added that arguments against joining had weakened . 
Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher , widely believed to be the strongest government opponent of full EMS membership , has made clear she does not expect to consider joining until after the next UK election , due by mid-1988 at the latest . 
But Lawson , in answer to a question , told reporters after an informal European Community finance ministers ' meeting here that other factors apart from the upcoming election stood in the way of full membership . 
In addition to the question of the exchange rates at which Britain should enter the EMS 's core exchange rate mechanism , there was also the impact of sterling membership on the system to be considered , he said . 
British entry would change the EMS from a monopolar system based on the West German mark to a bipolar mark-sterling system , he noted . 
`` We have to make sure it would work . '' 
But Lawson added that some of the considerations that had made it difficult for Britain to join in the past now posed less of a problem . 
As an example he cited sterling 's role as a petrocurrency , which he said was diminishing . 
`` That argument has clearly weakened , '' he said . 
Lawson restated that the government was keeping the question of membership under review . 
EC AGREES ON NEED TO STRENGTHEN EMS . 
European Community -LRB- EC -RRB- finance ministers and central bankers agreed on the need for greater cooperation to strengthen the European Monetary System -LRB- EMS -RRB- against international market turbulence , officials said . 
`` There was a general will to reinforce the European Monetary System , with all that implies , '' Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens said yesterday after hosting a one-day session of informal talks at this Belgian coastal resort . 
The gathering was the first such discussion since the second major realignment of EMS parities within nine months in January . 
The system has come under severe strain as funds have flowed out of the slumping dollar and into the dominant EMS currency , the West German mark , sending it soaring against weaker currencies in the system . 
But Eyskens said February 's agreement between leading western industrialised nations to stabilise exchange rates at around current levels was working and this would allow the EC to speed up its efforts to boost the internal stability of the EMS . 
He told a news conference yesterday 's meeting agreed on the need for closer coordination among EMS member governments of interest rate policies and of interest rate differentials between different countries . 
They also agreed they needed better coordination of exchange market intervention to hold currencies stable , both when they reached their fixed EMS limits and within their agreed margins . 
But Eyskens said this coordination raised a whole range of technical problems and ministers would discuss these further in Luxembourg in June on the basis of proposals from the EC 's Monetary Committee and Committee of Central Bank Governors . 
He said the EC needed a set of indicators of economic convergence betwen Community countries and it was important that interest rates fulfilled this role together with exchange rates and inflation rates . 
The Belgian minister , whose country presently holds the presidency of the community , made clear the meeting had not produced any agreement to move radically forward in developing the EMS towards the EC 's long term goal of economic and monetary integration . 
`` We have committed ourselves to reestablishing the normal functioning of the system , '' Eyskens said . 
Eyskens has repeatedly stressed that he believes the EMS has to be reinforced if the EC 's plans to liberalise all movements of capital across national borders by 1992 are to go ahead . 
EC executive Commission President Jacques Delors told the meeting the authority would put forward proposals for a final phase of capital market liberalisation in October that would include safeguard clauses for member countries for which the move would create difficulties . 
Eyskens said the ministers and central bankers also discussed the need to `` dedramatise '' realignments of EMS parities by letting high-ranking monetary officials carry them out by telephone rather than calling a meeting of finance ministers . 
However , West German sources said Bonn Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg was unenthusiastic about the idea . 
British Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson told journalists that one of the technical issues raised by greater coordination of exchange market intervention was the question of which currencies should be used to intervene and held in central bank reserves . 
He said several EMS member countries believed the EMS would work better if central banks held each other 's currencies -- an issue of particular importance regarding West Germany since the Bundesbank holds only dollars in its foreign exchange reserves . 
He said the debate on dedramatising EMS realignments reflected a general feeling among participants that the way the January reshuffle had been conducted was unsatisfactory . 
The realignment was marked by acrimony between France and West Germany , with each side blaming the other for strains in the system that forced the parity overhaul . 
ZAMBIAN CURRENCY FALLS AT FOREIGN EXCHANGE AUCTION . 
The Zambian currency further depreciated yesterday at the second auction since the introduction of a two-tier foreign exchange system last month . 
The -LRB- central -RRB- Bank of Zambia said the kwacha was pegged at 16.99 to the dollar , compared to last week `` s rate of 15 to the dollar . 
The bank , which offered six mln dlrs at the auction , reported demand for 13.4 mln dlrs . 
At the previous auction , the government offered eight mln dlrs . 
Last month the government set a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha per dollar , subject to adjustment against a basket of five currencies , for certain official transactions . 
It also introduced a new weekly foreign exchange auction only for parastatal organisations and the private sector , where the exchange rate is allowed to float in accordance with market demand . 
The new auction system is designed to be more restrictive than the previous one , suspended in January after the central bank fell 10 weeks in arrears to successful bidders . 
Under the new system , no bidder , except the the state oil company Zimoil and the national airline Zambia Airways , is allowed to bid for more than five pct of the foreign exchange on offer . 
U.S. NAVY SAID INCREASING PRESENCE NEAR GULF . 
Defence Secretary Caspar Weinberger has ordered the U.S. Navy to increase its presence near the Gulf in an effort to fulfil President Reagan 's pledge to keep oil flowing to Europe and Japan , The New York Times reported . 
The newspaper quoted Pentagon officials as saying the Navy would keep the aircraft carrier Kitty Hawk on station in the Arabian Sea and the rest of the Indian Ocean until May , three months longer than planned . 
The Navy would then have a carrier battle group of six to eight warships in the area at all times rather than part of the time , as happens now , the paper said . 
The paper said that last month U.S. Intelligence sources said they had spotted land-based anti-ship missiles of a Chinese design known in the West as the HY-2 near the Strait of Hormuz . 
It said their purpose was seen as a signal Iran was ready to continue and perhaps step up the Gulf shipping war against Iraq . 
U.S. Carriers or battleships would sail out of range of those missiles , but within striking distance , the paper quoted officials as saying . 
From several hundred miles at sea , carriers could launch aircraft bombing runs or missile strikes , and battleships could fire long-range missiles , the paper said . 
ALGERIAN , SPANISH FIRMS AGREE QUICKSILVER PRICE . 
Algerian and Spanish producers which together meet 40 pct of the Western market 's needs in quicksilver have agreed to apply a minimum selling price of 300 dlrs per unit , the Algerian news agency APS said . 
The agreement was made during a meeting here last week between Algeria 's Entreprise Nationale des Non-ferreux et Substances Utiles -LRB- ENOF -RRB- and Spain 's Almaden to discuss the market situation . 
The two firms `` took note with regret that prices quoted by some specialised publications do not reflect the reality of the whole market since they take into account only part of the deals made , '' a statement by ENOF said . 
The result is that the prices quoted are far away from two firms ' production costs . 
`` They have thus decided that their selling price would not be linked any more to the prices quoted by these publications and that sales would be made at a minimum price of 300 dlrs fob per jar , which is close to their production cost , '' the statement said . 
It added that Turkish producers would join in when the two firms meet again in Madrid later this month . 
The price of quicksilver on the London Metal Exchange hovered around 200 dlrs this week . 
CHINA 'S FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES FALL DURING 1986 . 
China 's foreign exchange reserves totalled 10.514 billion dlrs at end-1986 , up from 10.37 billion at end-September but down from 11.9 billion at end-1985 , according to central bank figures published by the New China News Agency . 
The agency said 2.072 billion dlrs of the reserves was held by the state treasury , down from 2.26 billion at end-September , while 8.442 billion was held by the Bank of China , up from 8.11 billion . 
China 's outstanding foreign debts rose to 7.572 billion at end-1986 from 5.067 billion at end-1985 . 
Gold reserves stood at 12.67 mln ounces , unchanged over the year . 
IEA SEES ONE PCT GROWTH IN 1987 OECD OIL DEMAND . 
Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialised countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986 , the International Energy Agency -LRB- IEA -RRB- said . 
Oil use in the 24 countries of the OECD increased by around one pct in first quarter 1987 to 35.9 mln bpd , the IEA said in its Monthly Oil Market Report . 
Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels , as in 1986 . 
But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986 , the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year 's 3.6 pct , it said . 
The IEA said that assuming crude oil and product prices stay close to current levels , some destocking by end-users can be expected . 
If that happens , natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986 , and there may be slightly less growth in transport fuels . 
IEA estimates on April 1 put oil stocks in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes , representing 98 days of forward consumption . 
This is about the same level as at the begining of the year . 
The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks . 
It said initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year . 
This followed a small rise in January of 0.4 mln bpd but a decline of 1.5 mln bpd in February and 2.5 mln bpd in March . 
It is possible that final data will show a larger draw , particulary for March , it said . 
As crude production also fell , there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks , particularly at sea , the IEA said . 
Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April 1 against 316 mln on April 1 1986 . 
Governments built up strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in the period . 
The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with year-on-year company stocks also rising , more or less in line with consumption , after declining for five years , the IEA noted . 
Oil stocks on land in the U.S. And Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes on April 1 , down from the 214 mln tonnes on January 1 and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption , respectively . 
Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes on April 1 , down from the 154 mln on January 1 but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption . 
World oil supply fell in the first quarter by about two mln bpd to 45.2 mln bpd from 47.2 mln bpd in last quarter 1986 . 
This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 mln bpd in February from 16.5 mln bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from centrally-planned Economies , the IEA said . 
Total OPEC crude oil supply was 15.8 mln bpd in the first quarter , plus 1.4 mln bpd of NGLs , compared with 17.3 mln bpd of crude in the last three months of 1986 and 17.9 mln average for the whole of 1986 . 
Supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 mln bpd , against 28.5 mln bpd in the fourth quarter 1986 . 
A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 mln bpd in March from 3.6 mln bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline , the IEA said . 
Saudi Arabia `` s Opec-assigned output quota is 4.133 mln bpd . 
MARCH U.S. PURCHASING MANAGERS INDEX UP AT 53.9 . 
The U.S. economy in March improved at a faster rate than in February , with the National Association of Purchasing Management 's composite index rising to 53.9 pct from 51.9 pct , the NAPM said . 
The first quarter average for the index also was 53.9 pct . 
The NAPM said that , if this average were to continue for the rest of 1987 , it would be consistent with real gross national product growth of about three pct . 
An index reading above 50 pct generally indicates that the economy is in an expanding phase . 
One below 50 pct implies a declining economy . 
The NAPM said the economic improvement was evident in all of the indicators in the index except inventories , which declined slightly . 
New orders rose sharply in March , with production also higher . 
Vendor deliveries slowed , another sign that the economy improved in March . 
Employment expanded for the first time since August 1984 . 
Robert Bretz , chairman of the NAPM 's business survey committee and director of materials management at Pitney Bowes Inc < PBI > said `` the economy ended the first quarter with a healthy , if not substantial improvement . '' 
Bretz said the sharp rise in the growth of new orders in March assures a good beginning for the second quarter . 
Some 50 pct of the purchasing managers reported that they were paying higher prices in March than at the end of 1986 . 
Of those paying higher prices now , the average increase was put at 2.5 pct . 
The estimated average price increase anticipated by members for the remainder of 1987 is 2.1 pct . 
While prices continue to rise , the NAPM said that most purchasers do not see them as being significant . 
The composite index is a seasonally adjusted figure , based on five components of the NAPM business survey - new orders , production , vendor deliveries , inventories and employment . 
The monthly report is based on questions asked of purchasing managers at 250 U.S. industrial companies .

U.S. CREDIT MARKET OUTLOOK - CAUTIOUS TRADING . 
U.S. Bond trading is likely to remain cautious in the near term with a possible downward price bias as market participants focus on trends in the dollar , the economy and Federal Reserve policy , economists said . 
Most expect the economy to continue showing modest gains , that the dollar has more room to fall and that the Fed will keep policy essentially steady , perhaps for several months . 
Until trends are clearer , `` the market can only attempt to to establish and hold a new trading range at higher interest rates , '' said economists at Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . 
Merrill Lynch economists Raymond Stone and Ward McCarthy said that while the fundamentals generally bode for a healthy investment climate , the market will have no confidence in this environment until there is illumination of and confidence in U.S. Dollar policy . 
Salomon Brothers ' Henry Kaufman said the bond market , highly sensitized to dollar movements , could be encouraged if currency markets seem to be stabilizing or if U.S. And overseas economic growth is perceived as slowing sharply . 
`` The crucial question , however , is how soon either of these developments is likely to occur , '' Kaufman said . 
`` Market uncertainties and the erosion of portfolio manager confidence could continue portfolio selling pressure a while longer , '' said Philip Braverman , chief economist at Irving Securities Corp. . 
However , Braverman said that , `` from a longer term perspective , current -LRB- bond -RRB- prices provide a buying opportunity . '' 
Despite a nearly one-point bond price rebound Friday on unexpectedly weak March employment data , key 30-year Treasury bonds lost 2-1 points in price for the week as a whole and Thursday 's 7.93 pct closing yield was a 1987 high . 
Braverman said historical evidence suggests that a long bond yield in the 7.93 pct area provides a basis for optimism . 
Bonds closed at 7.86 pct on Friday . 
The Irving economist noted that three times last year , in a similar `` paroxysm of pessimism , '' the key bonds reached a similar closing yield high . 
Within three to six weeks in each instance , however , Braverman said bond prices recovered to bring the yield down sharply by 63 to 82 basis points . 
Mitchell Held of Smith Barney , Harris Upham and Co Inc said that many portfolio managers now believe yields could approach nine pct by midyear , which he considers unlikely . 
Held said that , since late 1986 , Smith Barney analysts have spoken about the risk that interest rates could move higher and they continue to believe that an upward bias is likely to persist over the next few months . 
Held said that in conversations with portfolio managers last week there appeared to be increasing belief that the rate rise had just begun and that yields could approach nine pct by midyear . 
Naturally , that would mean a sharp bond price fall . 
`` Yields could rise further over the next few months , but the rise should be less than the 65 basis point rise we 've seen since the start of the year , '' Held said . 
Most expect Fed policy to be neutral for bonds near term . 
`` The Fed is currently frozen into a fixed stance , '' said economists at Aubrey G. Lanston and Co Inc. . 
They said the Fed can not tighten policy and push up interest rates as might be appropriate to stabilize the dollar and head off renewed inflationary psychology . 
That might harm the fragile U.S. Economic expansion . 
The Lanston economists said , `` The Fed can not ease its policy stance to both foster more rapid economic growth and calm domestic and Third World debt jitters without the threat of causing a further decline in the dollar . '' 
Minutes of February 's Federal Open Market Committee -LRB- FOMC -RRB- meeting released Friday showed that while the FOMC left policy unchanged it was more inclined to firm rather than ease policy later if conditions in the economy , foreign exchange or credit markets warranted a policy shift . 
However , economists generally believe that continued fairly sluggish U.S. Economic growth and the financial strains on U.S. Banks resulting from their problem loans to developing countries rule out any Fed policy firming . 
There is broad agreement among economists that the FOMC at last Tuesday 's meeting also left Fed policy unchanged . 
This week 's U.S. Economic data are expected to have little impact . 
February consumer instalment credit numbers are due on Wednesday , with March producer price data out Friday . 
There may be mild relief in some quarters that the U.S. Purchasing Managers Composite Index , a closely-watched economic indicator , rose only to 53.9 pct in March from 51.9 pct . 
A Friday rumor had put the number far higher . 
The index 's first quarter average also was 53.9 pct , translating into real GNP growth of about three pct if continued through 1987 . 
Federal funds traded at 5-15 pct late Friday and are expected to open about there today with no Fed action seen . 
NATIONAL AUSTRALIA BANK LOWERS BENCHMARK PRIME . 
National Australia Bank Ltd < NABA.S > said it lowered its benchmark prime lending rate to 18.25 pct from 18.5 , effective today , but left its base rate at 18.5 . 
The benchmark reduction brings the rate into line with the prime rates of most of Australia 's trading banks , including those of two of the other three major trading banks . 
However , the rate is above the 18 pct - the lowest ruling rate - set by the other major , the Australia and New Zealand Banking Group Ltd < ANZA.S > , on Friday and effective today . 
The benchmark is based on short-term interest rate movements while the base rate is tied to longer-term trends . 
CAESARS WORLD BOARD APPROVES RECAPITALIZATION . 
Caesars World Inc < CAW > said its directors unanimously approved a recapitalization plan under which stockholders will get a cash distribution of 25 dlrs per share via a one-time special cash dividend and will retain their common stock ownership in Caesars World . 
Caesars World said it expects to raise the approximately one billion dlrs needed to pay the 25 dlr per share dividend and the expenses of recapitalization through around 200 mln dlrs in bank borrowings and a public sale of approximately 800 mln dlrs of debt . 
Some outstanding debt will be retired . 
Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc , Caesars ' financial advisor , has told the company it is confident it can arrange the entire financing needed for the recapitalization . 
Henry Gluck , chairman and chief executive officer of the hotel , casino and resorts company , said in a statement the board believes the recapitalization plan is financially superior to a 28 dlr a share tender offer by Martin Sosnoff . 
Gluck said the Caesars World board once again recommends that shareholders reject the Sosnoff offer . 
The stock closed at 29.25 dlrs a share on Friday . 
`` Our ability to restructure along these lines is possible primarily because of the financial stability and the strong operating results achieved by management in recent years , '' Gluck said . 
He said that after the recapitalization takes effect , proforma net income for the fiscal year ended July 31 , 1988 is expected to be about 28.7 mln dlrs . 
Fiscal 1988 primary earnings per share are projected to be 76 cents , based on about 37.8 mln in post-recapitalization common and common-equivalent shares outstanding . 
Commenting on the company 's longer term earnings outlook , Gluck said `` we project net income to increase to 86.2 mln dlrs in 1992 , reflecting increased operating income and lower interest expense due to the retirement of 267 mln dlrs of debt incurred in connection with the recapitalization . '' 
He said the company does not usually release projections , but has done so now beause of the significance of the recapitalization . 
Gluck said the recapitalization plan will be submitted for stockholder approval at a special meeting expected in June . 
The plan will require the approval of stockholders and that of the Nevada and New Jersey gaming regulatory authorities . 
As part of the plan , the company will change its state of incorporation from Florida to Delaware by means of a merger of Caesars World into a wholly owned subsidiary of the company . 
The new incorporation certificate and bylaws will provide for , among other things , a `` fair price '' provision requiring that certain transactions with interested 15 pct stockholders be approved by an 80 pct vote of stockholders , excluding shares held by such interested stockholders . 
Caesars World said in a statement that `` the cash distribution will result in a substantial deficit in stockholders ' equity . '' 
It did not give an estimate of the size of this deficit . 
But the company said its financial advisors have said they believe that after the recapitalization , Caesars World should have the financial flexibility and resources necessary to finance its current and projected operating and capital requirements . 
AUSTRALIAN GAS LIGHT CO COUNTER-BIDS FOR TMOC . 
< The Australian Gas Light Co > -LRB- AGL -RRB- said it will offer one share plus one dlr cash for every two shares in oil and gas producer < TMOC Resources Ltd > in a counter-bid to the previously reported takeover offer by Santos Ltd < STOS.S > . 
The offer values TMOC shares at 4.75 dlrs each , based on AGL 's closing price of 8.50 dlrs on Friday . 
TMOC shares jumped to 4.60 dlrs on the announcement from its Friday closing price of 4.15 . 
The AGL offer , the third to be made for TMOC this year , compares with the Santos cash offer of 4.00 dlrs a share . 
Based on TMOC 's issued capital of 62.08 mln shares , the AGL offer values the entire company at 249.9 mln shares . 
AGL said in a statement that it already holds 10.5 pct of TMOC 's issued capital . 
This compares with the Santos stake of 3.1 pct when it announced its bid in March 23 . 
< Elders Resources Ltd > began the auction for TMOC about three months ago with an unsuccessful 2.55 dlrs a share on-market offer that has since lapsed . 
AGL said its offer is above the upper end of the range of values placed on TMOC by its advisers in the company 's response urging rejection of the Elders Resources bid . 
AGL said it will make the same offer for TMOC 's convertible notes . 
Accepting share and note holders will participate in AGL 's planned one-for-one bonus issue . 
It said TMOC is already a partner with AGL in the Alice Springs to Darwin gas pipeline and has a number of businesses complementary with those of AGL . 
AGL is the New South Wales natural gas utility while TMOC has extensive onshore holdings , mainly in Queensland where it owns the Moonie oil field and in the Northern Territory where it operates and holds 43.75 of the Mereenie oil-gas field . 
It also has interests in a number of gas or oil pipelines . 
IEA FORECASTS SLOWER GROWTH IN OECD OIL DEMAND . 
Growth in oil consumption in the Western industrialized countries is likely to slow to around one pct this year compared with 2.3 pct in 1986 , the International Energy Agency said . 
Oil use in the 24 member countries of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- increased by around one pct in the first quarter of 1987 to 35.9 mln barrels a day , the IEA said in its latest monthly report . 
Growth in OECD countries is expected to come primarily from transport fuels , as was the case in 1986 . 
But if average consumer prices are higher than 1986 , the rate of growth for these fuels may be below last year 's 3.6 pct . 
The IEA said assuming crude and product prices remain nar current levels , some destocking by end-users can be expected . 
If that takes place , natural gas will also regain some of the market share it lost to heavy fuel in 1986 , it said . 
IEA estimates on April one put oil stocks held in the OECD area at 428 mln tonnes , or 98 days of forward consumption . 
This is about the same as at the begining of the year . 
The agency said this flat trend is explained by the projected seasonal consumption decline in the second quarter of the year which offset a reduction in stocks . 
Company stocks on land in the OECD rose to 326 mln tonnes on April one this year compared with 316 mln tonnes in calender 1986 while governments also built up their strategic stocks to 102 mln tonnes against 97 mln in 1986 . 
The year-on-year trend of government stock building is continuing with company stocks rising , more or less in line with consumption , after declining for five years , IEA said . 
Oil stocks on land in the United States and Canada were put at 206.6 mln tonnes down from the 214 mln tonnes on January one and equivalent to 94 and 98 days of consumption , respectively . 
Oil stocks in Western Europe were 147.4 mln tonnes , down from the 154 mln tonnes on January one but still equivalent to 94 days of consumption . 
The IEA said that initial estimates indicate that company stocks fell by 1.2 mln bpd in OECD countries in the first quarter of the year . 
This followed a small rise in January of 400,000 bpd but a decline of 1.5 bpd in February and 2.5 bpd in March . 
And it is possible that final data will show a larger draw , particulary for March , it said . 
As crude production also fell , there is likely to have also been a decline in non-reported stocks , particularly at sea , the IEA said . 
World oil supply fell through the first quarter by about two bpd to 45.2 bpd from 47.5 bpd in the last quarter of 1986 . 
This drop was mostly due to a decline in OPEC crude production to around 15.5 bpd in February from 16.5 bpd in January and to the seasonal drop in exports from Centrally Planned Economies , the IEA said . 
Total OPEC oil supply totalled 17.2 bpd in the first quarter of 1987 compare with 19.3 bpd in the last three months of 1986 while supply from non-OPEC countries totalled 28 bpd as against 28.2 bpd in the same 1986 period . 
A drop in Saudi Arabian output to a tentatively forecast 3.3 bpd in march from 3.6 bpd in February was the largest factor behind the OPEC production decline , the IEA said . 
PHILIPPINE COFFEE EXPORTS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY . 
Philippine coffee exports are expected to fall sharply due to a combination of the International Coffee Organisation 's -LRB- ICO -RRB- decision not to revive export quotas and higher local prices , ICO Certifying Agency official Dante de Guzman told Reuters . 
He said exporter registrations dropped from an average weekly 500 tonnes in March to 45 tonnes last week , with exports in coffee year 1986 , ending September , forecast to total about 8,000 tonnes against 48,000 in 1985 . 
`` Because of the relatively higher level of domestic prices , it has become difficult to service exports , '' de Guzman said , adding that most exporters are taking a wait and see attitude . 
Coffee production was expected to drop slightly to about one mln bags of 60 kg each in the 1986 crop year ending June from 1.1 mln bags last year , he said .

LEADING COCOA PRODUCERS DISCUSS INTERNATIONAL PACT . 
Leading cocoa producers will discuss whether newly-agreed rules on an international cocoa buffer stock will succeed in reversing a sharp fall in world prices when they start four day 's of talks here later today , conference sources said . 
Another topic likely to be discussed at the twice-yearly meeting of the Cocoa Producer Alliance -LRB- CPA -RRB- is the pact 's second line of market support -- a witholding scheme under which exporters can take up to 120,000 tonnes of cocoa off the market if buffer stock purchases fail to defend prices . 
The International Cocoa Organisation is due to discuss the scheme at a meeting in June , and exporters could use the Yaounde talks to work out a common position on the issue , the sources said . 
Delegates will also be briefed on arrangements for an international cocoa research conference due to take place in Santo Domingo in the Dominican Republic next month , CPA secretary general D.S. Kamga said . 
The 11-member CPA include the world 's top three producers of Ivory Coast , Brazil and Ghana and accounts for around 80 pct of world output .

SOUTH KOREA 'S 1987 GNP SEEN GROWING NINE PCT . 
South Korea 's gross national product -LRB- gnp -RRB- is forecast to grow by nine pct in 1987 , surpassing the government 's original forecast of eight pct and against a 12.5 pct rise in 1986 , an Economic Planning Board report said . 
The report reviewing the country 's economy in the first three months of this year said year-on-year gnp was provisionally estimated to have grown by about 12 pct in the period , against a 10.5 pct growth in the same 1986 period . 
Board officials said the gnp rise in the January-March period is due largely to increased exports , which totalled 9.34 billion dlrs against 6.9 billion a year earlier .

CHINESE CROPS HIT BY FROST , SNOW AND RAIN IN MARCH . 
Wheat and rapeseed crops in east China suffered considerable damage because of frost during a spell of unusually cold weather in late March , the China Daily said . 
It said average temperatures for the last 10 days of March in most of east China were three to five degrees centigrade below average . 
Snow fell in Jiangsu , Anhui , Hubei and Henan , making early rice sowing difficult . 
Heavy snow blanketted central and south Jilin and north Liaoning , leaving farmland too muddy for spring ploughing and sowing , the paper said . 
The paper said rainfall during the last 10 days of March in areas south of the Yangtze had been much higher than normal . 
Heavy rain fell last Sunday in parts of Guangdong , ending a particularly arid dry season and marking the start of the flood season , it said . 
It gave no further details . 
The New China News Agency said rain and snow in Henan had improved the prospects for wheat , sown on 4.8 mln hectares , and caused a drop in grain prices at rural fairs since late February . 
It gave no 1986 figures for comparison .

Alcan Aluminium Ltd is closing its aluminum smelter in Ludwigshafen , West Germany this June due to high operating costs , an Alcan spokesman said . 
The smelter , near Frankfurt , had annual capacity of about 44,000 tonnes but was operating at about half that in January , spokesman Fernand Leclerc said . 
Leclerc said Alcan decided it would cost too much to modernize the plant . 
He said there is a possibility the company will sell the smelter , which currently employs 320 people , before its scheduled closing . 
KUWAIT MAY RE-REGISTER GULF TANKERS - NEWSPAPER . 
Kuwait may re-register part of its tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions , including the U.S. And USSR , in an attempt to protect them from Iranian missile attacks in the Gulf war zone , U.S. Officials were quoted by the New York Times as saying . 
The transfers would allow the country of registration to escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf . 
Kuwait had earlier declined an offer of U.S. Naval escorts as too public an admission of its need for protection , they said . 
Kuwait is also looking at flagging-out to European registries , the officials said . 
Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the Gulf may get Soviet escorts , the officials said . 
Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S. Escorts , but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a naval role in the region , the newspaper quoted the officials as saying . 
Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran and its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian attacks . 
The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month on methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships . 
CHASE-AMP BANK CUTS AUSTRALIAN PRIME TO 17.75 PCT . 
< Chase-AMP Bank Ltd > said it will lower its prime lending rate to 17.75 pct from 18.25 , effective tomorrow . 
The bank is the first to lower its prime rate below the 18 pct set by a few banks in the last few days in a continuation of a downward trend which began late last month . 
Other prime rates range from 18.25 to 18.5 pct , with the majority on 18.25 . 
The bank said the reduction reflected the recent downturn in money market rates , the improved economic outlook and adequate liquidity in the second quarter tax rundown period . 
SWISS CONSUMER PRICES RISE ONE PCT IN MARCH .

Both home produced and imported goods rose by 0.1 pct during the month . 
But over the year as a whole , domestically generated inflation reached 2.5 pct , offset by a 2.8 pct drop in imports .

The system calls on the agency to buy beef from trading houses and simultaneously sell it to users in one tender . 
The tender quota in April-September is 10 pct of the agency 's beef import share . 
Japan 's beef import quota in 1987 was set at 93,000 tonnes against 85,000 for the same period in 1986 .

SOVIET GRAIN PRODUCTS MINISTRY CRITICISED . 
The Soviet Communist Party has criticised the country 's Grain Products Ministry for failing to ensure proper grain storage , turning out poor quality bread and for unsatisfactory book keeping , Pravda said . 
The party daily said that losses in the industry owing to waste and theft amounted to 7.3 mln roubles over the last two and a half years . 
The situation was particularly bad in the Central Asian republic of Kazakhstan , which has been severely criticised since the ousting of its veteran leader Dinmukhamed Kunayev last December . 
Its new leader , Gennady Kolbin , has said that at times the grain-growing republic has performed so badly that it has been obliged to seek grain supplies from national reserves . 
Tass news agency announced yesterday that Grain Products Minister Grigory Zolotukhin , 75 , was being retired and replaced by Alexander Budyka , a senior food industry official . 
Pravda added today that the crisis in the industry had been drawn to Zolotukhin 's attention and two of his deputies reprimanded . 
COCOA BUFFER STOCK MAY FACE UPHILL BATTLE - TRADE . 
The International Cocoa Organization -LRB- ICCO -RRB- buffer stock could face an uphill battle to halt the downtrend in world cocoa prices when it begins buying operations in the next few weeks , cocoa traders said . 
Traders said they believed buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes in a matter of weeks without lifting prices significantly , given the amount of surplus cocoa overhanging the market . 
The buffer stock may begin buying shortly as the ICCO 10 day average indicator price is now at 1,578.03 Special Drawing Rights -LRB- SDR -RRB- per tonne , below the 1,600 `` must buy '' level . 
Rules governing buffer stock operations were agreed last month by the ICCO council . 
Buying will begin once the buffer stock manager has completed preparations , traders said . 
Some traders said the buffer stock manager may delay buffer stock buying until mid or end-April when changes in months used to calculate the ICCO indicator may lift the 10 day average above the 1,600 SDR `` must buy '' level . 
The ICCO indicator price is calculated from the average of the second , third and fourth positions on the London and New York futures markets . 
The daily price was 1,577.61 SDR per tonne yesterday . 
Months used currently for the indicator are May , July and September , but these are set to change to July , September and December on April 15 , prior to May becoming the New York spot month , traders noted . 
The introduction of December into the calculations may lift the daily SDR price as December is currently quoted about 75 stg above May on the London terminal market . 
But the buffer stock manager would have to wait for the higher daily price to feed through into the 10-day average , the indicator which governs his activities , traders said . 
`` The buffer stock manager is obviously looking at the implications of delaying until forward prices lift the indicator since it might mean he has to buy less cocoa , '' an analyst from a leading cocoa trade house said . 
Traders said the buffer stock purchases could reach 75,000 tonnes fairly quickly once buying starts . 
If purchases reach this level within six months , buying is suspended pending an ICCO council review of price ranges . 
But some cocoa market watchers said the buffer stock may benefit from recent forecasts for a poor Brazilian Bahia temporao crop at 1.5 mln to two mln 60 kilo bags against initial expectations of up to three mln . 
A lower than expected Brazilian crop may cut the 1986 world surplus to between 50,000 and 70,000 tonnes , compared with a recent forecast by the ICCO statistics committee of 94,000 tonnes , traders said . 
In these circumstances , the buffer stock may only need to buy between 20,000 and 30,000 tonnes to lift prices above the `` must buy '' level . 
But some dealers said the ICCO buffer stock rules may put constraints on how quickly and effectively the buffer stock manager can remove cocoa from the market . 
The buffer stock system of price differentials set according to quality and a 15 pct limit on purchases from non-members could limit the buffer stock 's scope for action , dealers said . 
Most of the cocoa readily available to the buffer stock is nearby in-store material of Malaysian and Ivory Coast origin . 
But the buffer stock can only buy 15 pct Malaysian cocoa as Malaysia is not an ICCO member , while purchases of nearby cocoa can only reach 40 pct in any one day , which forces the buffer stock to buy some intermediate and forward shipment material . 
Limits on buffer stock purchases of nearby and non-member cocoa will reduce the impact on terminal prices which are pressured by the overhang of Malaysian material , traders said . 
Buffer stock purchases of forward shipment cocoa from quality producers such as Ghana will have only a limited impact on futures , but is likely to widen physical market premiums for this cocoa over futures . 
Ghana 's premium to the terminal has risen to about 50 stg from 25 to 30 stg a month ago partly in anticipation of buffer stock buying , dealers said . 
`` The buffer stock may not help the terminal market , but will provide a backstop for quality cocoas , '' one trader said . 
Traders cautioned that views on the impact of the buffer stock were `` all prognostication '' and that no one could hope to predict accurately what the result would be . 
Psychologically buffer stock buying should help prices , but since the buffer stock already holds a carryover of 100,000 tonnes from the previous cocoa agreement and the market is in surplus , dealers expressed doubts purchases can counter bearish pressure . 
In June the ICCO is due to discuss rules for a withholding scheme as an additional market support mechanism .

U.S. WINE EXPORTS ROSE 15 PER CENT LAST YEAR . 
Exports of American wine rose 14.9 per cent last year to a total of 7.2 million gallons , the Wine Institute said . 
The San Francisco-based promotional group said 95 per cent of the exported wine was from California and the top three markets were Canada , Japan and Britain .

Canadian imports rose 3.2 per cent to 2.6 million gallons ; Japan , 9.9 per cent to 1.2 million gallons , and Britain , 20.2 per cent to 962,360 gallons . 
A spokesman for the institute said the declining value of the dollar and strong promotional efforts on the part of the California wine industry contributed significantly to the increased shipments . 
The 1986 wine exports were valued at 34.7 mln dlrs , up from 27.6 mln dlrs the previous year . 
GERMAN CAPITAL ACCOUNT IN DEFICIT IN FEBRUARY . 
West Germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks on the February capital account , combining long and short term capital flows , compared with a net inflow of 11.91 billion marks in January , the Bundesbank said .

NO INTERVENTION , DOLLAR FIXED AT 1.8218 MARKS . 
The Bundesbank did not intervene as the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243 yesterday , dealers said . 
BANK OF JAPAN INTERVENES SHORTLY AFTER TOKYO OPENS . 
The Bank of Japan bought a small amount of dollars at around 145.95 yen shortly after the Tokyo market opened , dealers said . 
But the dollar then fell on speculative selling by trading houses , they said . 
The dollar had opened here at 145.95 yen against 145.85  90 yen in New York and 146.00 yen at the close here yesterday . 
BANK OF JAPAN TO SELL 800 BILLION YEN IN BILLS . 
The Bank of Japan will sell tomorrow a total of 800 billion yen worth of financing bills from its holdings to help absorb a projected money market surplus of 1,300 billion yen , money traders said . 
Of the total , 400 billion yen will yield 3.8502 pct on sales from money houses to banks and securities houses in a 41-day repurchase accord maturing on May 19 . 
Another 400 billion yen will yield 3.7991 pct in a 20-day repurchase pact maturing on April 28 , they said . 
The repurchase agreement yields compare with the 3.8125 pct one-month , and 3.7500 pct three-week commercial bill discount rates today . 
Tomorrow 's surplus is attributable to government tax allocations to local governments and public entities . 
The operation will put outstanding bill supply at about 4,300 billion yen , they said . 
NO INTERVENTION , DOLLAR FIXED AT 1.8218 MARKS . 
The Bundesbank did not intervene as the dollar was fixed lower at 1.8218 marks after 1.8243 yesterday , dealers said . 
Dealers said dollar trading was very quiet over the European morning , with operators made wary by today 's meeting of the Group of Five finance ministers and central bank chiefs ahead of the full IMF Bank session in Washington . 
It was undermined by remarks from U.S. Council of Economic Advisers Chairman Beryl Sprinkel who told Iowa bankers the U.S. Had no objective regarding the value of the dollar . 
Sprinkel also called the reference to stabilizing exchange rates at about current levels , made at the Paris meeting on February 22 , a `` vague statement , '' casting doubt on operators ' assumptions that a secret target level had been set . 
Sprinkel added that if West Germany and Japan made progress to stimulate their economies as the Paris agreement envisaged , `` there would not be the necessity of significant declines in the dollar . '' 
One dealer for a U.S.-based bank noted the dollar tended easier after the remarks . 
`` They were obviously regarded as being negative . 
And if the market starts regarding anything that comes out negatively then it means that the underlying sentiment is negative , '' he said . 
Some early selling pressure softened the dollar 's undertone . 
Most operators overlooked intervention by the Bank of Japan to support the dollar against selling in favour of the yen by institutional investors and overseas operators , dealers said . 
After the strong focus on the dollar rate in recent weeks up to the end of the Japanese financial year on March 31 , interest and activity was likely to switch , dealers said . 
`` We can start to look at a point in time where the interest shifts away from dollar and more into dollar and the other European currencies , '' the U.S. Bank dealer said . 
Despite the softer undertone , traders would remain wary of taking significant new positions during the Washington meetings , dealers said . 
Aside from the G-5 session today , Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl is due to meet the German Affairs group on international monetary issues later . 
The mark gained some strength from news the Bundesbank set a new securities repurchase tender to add money market liquidity at a fixed 3.80 pct , unchanged from those over the last several weeks . 
Some expectation had been growing that it might cut the rate or move to a minimum interest rate tender , signalling a desire for a slight easing in credit policy . 
Bundesbank central bank council member Lothar Mueller said the Bundesbank had not given up its focus on money supply . 
A monetary policy which took into account exchange rates and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange-rate oriented policy , he said , contradicting some growing sentiment . 
Sterling eased a touch to 2.950 marks at the fixing from 2.957 . 
The yen 's unabated strength , despite the intervention , brought it up to 1.2555 marks per 100 from yesterday 's 1.2480 . 
The Swiss franc rose to a fix of 120.515 marks per 100 from 120.180 . 
The French franc eased to 30.055 marks per 100 after 30.060 , Belgian franc was little changed at 4.829 marks per 100 .

KUWAIT MAY RE-REGISTER GULF TANKERS - NEWSPAPER . 
Kuwait may re-register part of its tanker fleet with foreign flag jurisdictions , including the U.S. And USSR , in an attempt to protect them from Iranian missile attacks in the Gulf war zone , U.S. Officials were quoted by the New York Times as saying . 
The transfers would allow the country of registration to escort Kuwaiti-owned ships in the Gulf .

Soviet flag tankers transporting Kuwaiti oil through the Gulf may get Soviet escorts , the officials said . 
Kuwait had earlier considered having both USSR and U.S. Escorts , but the U.S. Was unwilling to give the Soviet Union a naval role in the region , the newspaper quoted the officials as saying . 
Kuwait has backed Iraq in the seven-year war against Iran and its ships have increasingly been the target of Iranian attacks . 
The U.S. And Kuwait have been negotiating for over a month on methods of protecting Kuwaiti ships .

EC INDUSTRIAL PRODUCTION GROWTH HALTS IN JANUARY . 
Industrial production in the European Community -LRB- EC -RRB- in January showed no growth compared with January 1986 , the EC statistics office , Eurostat , said in a report . 
It said the EC industrial production index , base 1980 , stood at 103.9 in both months . 
EC officials said while the lack of growth may have been due in part to the icy weather which gripped large parts of the EC in January , it also reflects a worrying trend . 
Eurostat said for the last three months for which figures are known , industrial output rose by only 0.9 pct compared with the year-earlier period . 
Annual growth in the 12 months to January averaged about 1.8 pct , well below the 2.8 pct figure recorded in the 12 months ending last June , the office said . 
U.S. SENATE PANEL COULD CONSIDER TRADE MEASURE . 
The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee may take up a bill tomorrow that would strengthen the activities of U.S. agricultural trade teams in selected developing countries , committee staff said . 
The measure , sponsored by committee Chairman Patrick Leahy -LRB- D-Vt . -RRB- 
and Sen. John Melcher -LRB- D-Mont . -RRB- 
, would establish trade teams of between six and nine persons drawn from federal agencies and private voluntary organizations , staff said . 
The trade missions would seek to generate interest in the U.S. government 's food donation and commercial programs -- PL480 , Section 416 , export credit and export enhancement -- and upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional or commercial benefits to interested countries . 
The trade teams would be made up of representatives of the U.S. Agriculture Department , State Department , the Agency for International Development and private voluntary organizations such as U.S. Wheat Associates . 
The bill would require teams within six months to visit seven countries : Mexico , Philippines , Indonesia , India , Bangladesh , Senegal and Nigeria . 
Within one year after passage of the measure , another eight countries would have to be visited : Peru , Kenya , the Dominican Republic , Costa Rica , Malaysia , Venezuela , Tunisia and Morocco . 
Other countries could be added to the list . 
Senate staff members said the bill , still in the drafting stages , had broad support and was expected to be approved by the committee tomorrow .

GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH . 
A study on grain certificates due out shortly from the Government Accounting Office -LRB- GAO -RRB- could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays , administration and industry sources said . 
Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments , a GAO official told Reuters . 
GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms -LRB- R-N.C . -RRB- 
, former chairman of the senate agriculture committee . 
The report , which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash , is scheduled to be released in mid March . 
The cost of certificates , said the GAO source , depends on the program 's impact on the USDA loan program . 
If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures , then the net cost of the program would go up . 
However , if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease , the cost effect of certificates would be less . 
GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded , the GAO official said . 
But a negative report on certificates `` will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program , '' an agricultural consultant said . 
The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program , while USDA remains firmly committed to it . 
CITY INVESTING TRUST < CNVLZ > SETS CASH PAYOUT .

FCOJ SUPPLIES SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE YEAR AGO-USDA . 
Total supply of frozen concentrated orange juice -LRB- FCOJ -RRB- in 1986 is expected to be significantly above year-earlier levels , even with carry-in stocks well below the previous season , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . 
In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report , the Department said Florida 's imports of FCOJ , mostly from Brazil , have shown sharp gains to date . 
The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be affected by the final decision , scheduled for April 22 , on whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S. have caused injury . 
Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier . 
The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year earlier , but strong demand has kept apple prices firm . 
In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced supplies , apple prices are projected to stay firm .

BP SCOTTISH REFINERY SET TO RESTART THIS WEEK . 
The British Petroleum < BP.L > Co Plc 's refinery at Grangemouth , Scotland , shut down after an explosion and fire in the hydrocracker on March 22 , will probably be back in operation towards the week-end , a refinery spokesman said . 
He said the refinery will resume at about half its 178,500 barrels per day -LRB- bpd -RRB- capacity , as work on overhauling the North Side of the complex , which began at the end of January , will not be completed before the end of April . 
He said the refinery had been closed for longer than originally expected due to the lengthy safety checks being carried out prior to restarting . 
The explosion and fire , in which one worker was killed , caused extensive damage to the central part of the 32,000 hydrocracker and the spokesman said today this unit would be out of operation for several months . 
The remainder of the refinery , including the 19,000 catalytic cracker , was undamaged . 
He said inquiries into the accident , which happened while the hydrocracker was not in operation , were continuing . 
In an earlier incident , two people were killed in an explosion and fire at the refinery on March 13 .

BRITAIN WARNS JAPAN OVER TRADE ROW . 
British corporate affairs minister Michael Howard told Japan to resolve the row over the U.K. Firm Cable and Wireless Plc 's < CAWL.L > shareholding in a new Japanese telecommunications company or face an abrupt deterioration in trade relations . 
In meetings with both the foreign and telecommunications ministers Howard said he expressed deep concern about the way Tokyo had handled the dispute and about the continuing trade imbalance between the two countries . 
`` I put it to the -LRB- post and telecommunications -RRB- minister that I was sure he did not want to be responsible for an abrupt deterioration in the trading relations of our countries which would have widespread reverberations elsewhere in the world , '' Howard told reporters . 
`` He listened very carefully and I have little doubt the message got home , '' he added . 
British frustration over the lopsided trade balance - nearly six billion dlrs in Japan 's favour last year - has reached boiling point over the telecommunications issue , Howard said . 
Howard has accused Japan of trying to shut out Cable and Wireless from having a major role in the international telephone market in Japan . 
`` I want a fair crack of the whip for Cable and Wireless as I want a fair crack of the whip for Britain generally in trading relations , '' Howard said . 
`` We simply are n't prepared to continue to accept the imbalance which has been the position for such a long time . '' 
Post and Telecommunications Ministry officials were unable to comment on Howard 's meeting with their minister . 
But Foreign Ministry officials said Foreign Minister Tadashi Kuranari said that British exports to Japan are increasing , but acknowledged the continuing imbalance in trade . 
Kuranari said he wants everyone in the telecommunications dispute , including Cable and Wireless , to be satisfied . 
Howard told reporters that Britain was actively considering possible retaliatory measures if it did not get its way on the telecommunications issue . 
`` There are measures which are under consideration if we continue to suffer from the imbalance in our trading relations , '' he added , but gave no details . 
He said he had received a reassuring response from the Japanese he has spoken with . 
`` But of course we 've had reassuring signs from the Japanese for quite some time , '' he added . 
`` What I 've made plain is we expect to see action . '' 
Howard ruled out using powers in Britain 's Financial Services bill to retaliate against unfair trade practices . 
Those powers , which allow London to ban foreign financial firms like banks from Britain , are designed to ensure U.K. Firms equal access to overseas financial markets . 
CARDINAL INDUSTRIES < CDNI > RESTATES NET LOWER . 
Cardinal Industries Inc said it restated earnings for the first nine months of 1986 to 235,000 dlrs , or nine cts per share , from 485,000 dlrs , or 18 cts , reported previously due to the failure of an automated accounting system installed in mid-year and replaced in the fourth quarter .

BRAZIL SEAMEN 'S STRIKE ENDS . 
A Brazilian seamen 's strike , which began on February 27 and has been tapering off for weeks , has now ended , a seamen 's spokesman said . 
The spokesman said the seamen had signed an agreement with the state-owned Lloyd Brasileiro company on Saturday for a 120 pct salary rise . 
The national strike had been tailing off since mid-March as seamen struck individual accords with companies . 
At the height of the stoppage , seamen said about 200 ships were strike-bound . 
U.S. CORN , SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50-50 CASH . 
Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S. corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . 
It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs . 
Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit control act of 1985 , it said . 
Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs , respectively , USDA said . 
The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments . 
Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate , or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year -- September-January . 
National weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and 1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum . 
Eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel , based on the difference between the 3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate . 
Sorghum producers ' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents per bushel , based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan rate . 
The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law , the department said . 
Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates , the department said . 
The payments will be issued through local Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices , it said .

USDA PROPOSES NAME CHANGES IN BEEF GRADE . 
The U.S. Agriculture Department proposes to rename the `` USDA Good '' grade of beef to `` USDA Select . '' 
The department said the proposed change is in response to a petition from Public Voice for Food and Health Policy and would present a more positive image of this grade of beef and help calorie-conscious consumers select leaner cuts of meat . 
Under current rules , the `` good '' grade of meat has less marbling and fat than the `` prime '' or `` choice '' grades , it said .

PALM OIL OUTPUT SEEN DROPPING SHARPLY - OIL WORLD . 
Malaysian and Indonesian palm oil production is likely to drop sharply this year , due to lower yields , the Hamburg-based newsletter Oil World said . 
The publication expects total Malaysian output during Jan 1987 to decline by eight pct to 3.05 mln tonnes . 
For East Malaysia , it put production during the period at 297,000 tonnes after 312,000 a year earlier and for West Malaysia 2.75 mln compared with just over 3.0 mln during Jan 1986 . 
It said new plantings had slowed markedly in both countries , but the effects of this will not be felt until 1988-90 . 
Above normal yields during recent years resulted in trees reacting to the stress by changing the sex ratio to more male inflorescences and aborting more female , Oil World said . 
Yields per hectare are also likely to be adversely affected this year by insufficient rain up to 25 months ago . 
This could especially affect trees in West Malaysia during April , while in East Malaysia the impact will be in February and July , and in Indonesia July . 
Last year 's cut in fertilizer use will hit this year 's yields and bigger effects are expected within the next three years , Oil World said without elaborating . 
Opening stocks in West Malaysia at the start of this year were put at only 565,000 tonnes compared with 914,000 in January 1986 , Oil World said . 
West Malaysian net exports are therefore expected to drop 500,000 tonnes to 2.54 mln during Jan , while those of East Malaysia are likely to decline by 10 pct to 280,000 tonnes . 
Indonesian palm oil production is forecast to fall about eight pct during Jan , but to rise from June on . 
Overall Indonesian output during Jan is forecast to rise three pct to 933,000 tonnes . 
Indonesian stocks as of April 1 , however , are put at only 65,000 tonnes compared with 160,000 a year ago . 
Indonesian export commitments and domestic requirements are both running at high levels , Oil World said , and it expects the country 's imports to reach a record 110,000 tonnes during Jan . 
The bulk of this will arrive during Feb , ahead of the April elections and the religious Ramadan festival throughout May , it said . 
Indonesian net exports , therefore , may fall by 29 pct to 350,000 tonnes , Oil World said . 
The possibility that recent Indonesian palm oil purchases will not actually enter the country but be transshipped to other countries to fulfill Indonesia 's export orders can not be ruled out , it said . 
U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER 284 MLN STG HELP . 
The Bank of England said it provided the money market with a further 284 mln stg assistance in the afternoon session .

SYNGOLD DEFINES RESERVES ON DEKA PROPERTY . 
< Syngold Exploration Inc > and < Corp Falconbridge Copper > said they defined undiluted reserves of 911,000 tons of ore with an average grade of 0.43 ounces of gold per ton in two separate deposits on the Deka property located at Noranda , Quebec . 
Assay results from 20 suface holes drilled on 250 foot centers indicate that the Donalda number one deposit contains possible reserves of 611,000 tons at an average grade of 0.48 ounces of gold per ton . 
The number one deposit 's reserves are contained between a vertical depth of 750 and 1200 feet at a strike length of 900 feet . 
Reserves of the Donalda number-two deposit , located 1,000 feet below the number-one deposit , were recalculated at 300,000 tons with an average grade of 0.33 ounces of gold per ton . 
Syngold has earned a 20 pct interest in the Deka property from the operator , Corp Falconbridge Copper . 
AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES -- USDA . 
The Australian Government will likely reimburse the Australian Wheat Board , AWB , about 132 mln -LRB- U.S. -RRB- dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986 crop , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . 
In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains , the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne . 
For example the recent large sales of wheat to China -LRB- 1.5 mln tonnes -RRB- and Egypt -LRB- 2.0 mln tonnes -RRB- were well below the breakeven export price , it said . 
Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price , GMP , calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years , the department said . 
In addition , deductions for taxes , freight , handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives . 
But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics , BAE , predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986 to 13.5 mln in 1989 . 
The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports , the department said .

HUTTON < EFH > ENDS PUROLATOR < PCC > BID . 
Emery Air Freight Corp said it has entered into an agreement with E.F. Hutton Group Inc EFH under which Hutton will terminate its merger agreement with Purolator Courier Corp and its pending 35-dlr-per-share tender offer , effective April 13 . 
Under its merger agreement , Hutton has the right to unilaterally terminate the merger agreement under certain circumstances , including its receipt of less than 66-2 pct of Purolator shares or the start of a higher competing tender offer , such as Emery 's competing 40 dlr per share offer for Purolator stock . 
Yesterday , Hutton 's PC Acquisition Corp subsidiary extended its tender offer , which was to have expired at midnight , for two more days . 
It said it only about 450,000 shares , or 6.5 pct , of Purolator shares had been tendered and not withdrawn , down from an 11.5 pct interest held earlier . 
Emery 's bid expires April 28 . 
Emery said pending the termination of PC Acquisition 's merger agreement , PC has released Purolator from an agreement not to discuss Emery 's acquisition proposal with Emery . 
Emery said as a result it is renewing its request that Purolatr enter into merger negotiations with it . 
Emery said if it were to acquire 51 pct of Purolator shares or control of the Purolator board , it has agreed not to dispute PC Acquisition 's right to receive fees that Purolator agreed to pay if PC were unsuccessful in acquiring control of Purolator due to the acquisition of control by another party . 
The company said it has also agreed to let Purolator pay all of PC Acquisition 's documented expenses in connection with the merger agreement up to three mln dlrs and Emery has agreed to pay the amounts itself should Purolator fail to do so .

JAPAN CUTTING CHINA CORN COMMITMENTS - USDA . 
Japanese traders have apparently sharply reduced commitments to buy Chinese corn over the next six months due to high prices , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . 
In its World Production and Trade Report , the department said traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwilling to sell at current low world prices . 
If the reports are confirmed , China 's major export destinations such as USSR , Japan , and South Korea , could increase purchases of U.S. corn , it said . 
China is currently forecast to export 5.5 mln tonnes of corn during 1986 -LRB- Oct-Sept -RRB- , it said .

RUDING AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL , TRADE CURBS . 
Shifts in domestic economic policy , not a further fall in the dollar or trade restrictions , are the key to reducing imbalances in trade and payments , Dutch Finance Miniister H. Onno Ruding said . 
Ruding told a meeting of the World Trade Forum here that protectionism would naturally lead to retaliation and aggravate the problems of heavily indebted developing countries . 
`` The main contribution towards resolving the still enourmous U.S. trade deficit is not repeat not a further fall in the dollar , is not still more protectionism in your country . '' 
`` No , it is - like in other countries - changes in domestic economic and financial policies , '' Ruding said . 
Ruding said he was less worried about a crisis of the weakening dollar than he was in January before the Paris accord to stabilize foreign exchange rates . 
He said the highest priority should be given to policy changes in the United States , especially reducing the budget deficit and encouraging domestic savings . 
But he said other countries , such as Japan and West Germany , also needed to take greater steps toward reducing their trade surpluses . 
SAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION . 
Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas , said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer . 
Wellemeyer , speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference , also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong . 
`` Over the next few weeks I think you 'll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down , '' Wellemeyer said . 
`` The Saudis are committed to that price level -LRB- of 18 dlrs a barrel -RRB- and are willing to make it happen again , '' he said . 
In recent weeks , oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota , pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day . 
But prices rebounded today , with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output . 
Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993 . 
Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices , Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies . 
The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day , or 18 pct of the world demand for oil . 
CAROLYN BEAN < CBEN > COMPLETES ACQUISITION . 
Carolyn Bean Publishing Ltd said it has completed the acquisition of greeting card company Millen Cards , which had sales of over 1,500,000 dlrs in 1986 , for undisclosed terms . 
The company said 90 pct of Millen 's cards have been sold in the northeast and mid-Atlantic states , but Bean expects to increase sales to 2,500,000 dlrs this year by distributing the line nationally . 
Millen specializes in Jewish religious cards and also sells traditional greeting cards .

BALL < BLL > TO SUPPLY PENNY BLANKS TO MINTS . 
Ball Corp said it was awarded a one-year 12,750,000 dlr contract to supply copper-plated zinc penny blanks to the U.S. mints in Philadelphia and Denver . 
The new contract , effective in June , calls for shipping 23,200,000 pounds of blanks to the mint in Philadelphia and 7,600,000 pounds to Denver . 
It said the blanks will be manufactured in Greenville , Tenn. . 
Ball began supplying blanks to the San Francisco and West Point mints in 1981 when the penny 's content was changed to zinc from copper . 
EC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET - USDA . 
The European Community , EC , sold 75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85 and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . 
The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat , it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains . 
EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986 -LRB- July-June -RRB- in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985 season , it said . 
The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board , BWB , expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986 year . 
The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production , and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand , the USDA said . 
It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes , but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago .

VOLCKER WARNS AGAINST SIZEABLE DLR DECLINE . 
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said a further large drop in the value of the dollar could be counterproductive for world economic growth . 
Testifying before the Senate Banking Committee , Volcker said that Europe and Japan were slowing exports and that growth in those countries was also decreasing . 
`` In that kind of situation , further sizeable depreciation of the dollar could well be counterproductive , '' he said . 
Domestic expansion in foreign industrial countries has not been enough to offset the effects of slower exports , Volcker said . 
On the value of the dollar , Volcker said he could not say whether it should be higher or lower to restore balance in trade . 
`` What we do know is that a substantial exchange rate adjustment has already been made , '' he said . 
`` That adjustment should be large enough , in a context of a growing world economy and fiscal restraint in the United States , to support the widespread expectations of a narrowing in the real trade deficit in the period ahead , '' he said . 
Volcker said U.S. exports were now growing substantially while import growth should slow . 
Volcker said that to improve the trade deficit with a minimum of inflationary pressure , the United States would have to slow its spending growth . 
It would also have to achieve a better balance between investment and domestic savings if it wants to be able to dispense with foreign capital . 
`` The constructive way to work in the needed direction would be to reduce our budget deficit , year by year , paving the way for improvements in our trade accounts , '' he said . 
Relying on depreciation of the dollar alone would risk renewed inflation , he said . 
WALL STREET STOCKS LABS < MKC > . 
Marion Laboratories Inc 's stock rose sharply today after the company presented a bullish earnings scenario at a meeting for pharmaceutical analysts Monday , traders and analysts said . 
The company said it expects earnings for fiscal 1987 , ending June 30 , to rise more than 75 pct over a year ago . 
That pronouncement encouraged analyst David Crossen of Sanford C. Bernstein and Co to raise his earnings estimates for the company to 1.28 dlrs a share in 1987 , compared to his previous estimate of 1.20 dlrs a share . 
Last year the company earned 70 cts a share . 
Marion 's stock gained 3-1 to 75-1 . 
At the meeting of pharmaceutical analysts , Marion 's president Fred Lyons Jr. said Wall Street eanrings estimates of 1.10-1 .15 dlrs a share for fiscal 1987 `` are expected to cause even the aggressive side of this range to be 10 to 15 cts low . '' 
Lyons said the strong performance in the second half of this year will result from the fourth quarter introduction of 90 mg and 120 mg Cardizem tablets . 
Analyst Crossen said that Cardizem , which treats angina , is also expected to be approved for the treatment of hypertension by the end of the year . 
Crossen said `` because Marion is still just a small company , the growth of Cardizem is having a big impact on the bottom line . '' 
He raised fiscal 1988 earnings estimates to 2.15 dlrs a share from his previous estimate of 2.05 dlrs a share . 
`` The company has a broad new product pipeline in the industry and as far as I am concerned , it is the most innovative company in the business , '' he said . 
For the five years through 1991 , Crossen expects Marion to have a growth rate of 55 pct . 
U.S. CALLS FOR GREATER GATT CHECKS ON TRADE . 
The United States has appealed for stronger powers for the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- GATT -RRB- to enforce world trade rules . 
The call by U.S. Deputy Trade Representative Michael Smith at a special committee meeting into the future of GATT follows a series of bilateral trade rows which have clouded efforts by the 93-nation body to promote fair trade . 
Today 's meeting was part of the Uruguay trade round launched by ministers last September . 
The round , which covers 13 areas of trade in agriculture , manufactured goods and services will take four years to negotiate . 
Smith called for boosting GATT 's links with financial institutions such as the International Monetary Fund and World Bank . 
He also urged greater involvement of trade ministers to ensure the success of the Uruguay Round . 
`` The GATT as an institution needs to be strengthened to assure that the GATT plays its proper role in management of the world trading system and the global economy , '' Smith said . 
`` Rules can and will be ignored if the institution is weak , or perceived as unable to adapt to the changing world economy . '' 
He also also urged that member states be accountable to each other for their trade policies . 
Smith , who flies to Brussels today for talks with European Community -LRB- EC -RRB- officials , told Reuters the committee wanted to stress GATT 's importance and did not discuss specifics . 
`` We are interested in more periodic ministerial involvement ... Whether in formal or informal meetings , '' he said . 
GATT 's ruling council is due to hear a complaint from the 12-nation EC on April 15 about the U.S.-Japanese accord on semiconductors . 
The EC charges the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries and is requesting a GATT dispute panel be set up to review the agreement . 
President Reagan , who strongly supported the Uruguay trade round to promote freer trade , has said Washington will impose tariffs against Japanese electronic goods . 
He said Tokyo had not shown willingness to open its markets to U.S. Exports . 
ZENITH LABS < ZEN > WILL REPORT 4TH QTR LOSS . 
Zenith Laboratories Inc said the company will report a fourth quarter loss , and the amount will be determined on completion of its year end audit . 
The company did not elaborate further . 
For the third quarter ended Sept 30 , 1986 , Zenith reported a loss of 3,451,000 dlrs or 16 cts per share , adjusted for a May 1986 2-for-1 stock split . 
The company also said it received Food and Drug Administration approval to market Cefadroxil , a generic version of an antibiotic with domestic sales exceeding 50 mln dlrs in 1986 . 
Zenith said it will not market the drug until `` questions relating to the applicability of certain patents have been resolved . '' 
CHINA SOYBEAN OUTPUT DOWN SLIGHTLY - USDA REPORT . 
China 's soybean crop this year is forecast at 11.5 mln tonnes , down slightly from 11.55 mln estiamted for last year , the U.S. Agriculture Department 's officer in Peking said in a field report . 
The report , dated April 2 , said Chinese imports this year are projected at 300,000 tonnes unchanged from last year 's level . 
Exports are forecast to increase to 1.0 mln tonnes from 800,000 tonnes exported last year , the report said . 
Imports of soybean oil are estimated at 200,000 tonnes , also unchanged from last year .

VOLCKER URGES QUICK AID TO DEBTOR NATIONS . 
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said that debtor nations have made much progress in laying the groundwork for economic growth , but a solution to world debt difficulties was endangered by inaction on new financing . 
`` There is clearly a danger that adequate financing arrangements are not being negotiated and put in place in a timely way , '' Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee . 
The borrowing countries need to be able to proceed with confidence that the necessary funds will be available to them , he said . 
Brazil has the potential for becoming a leading world economic power , but it is in a difficult position today , Volcker said . 
He said it will take a concerted effort to regularize Brazil 's external payments . 
`` The key prerequisite is clearly in the hands of Brazilian authorities , '' he said . 
Both Brazil and its creditors have a strong incentive to work together , Volcker said . 
Regarding trade imbalances , Volcker said that it was critically important that markets be kept open by the industrial nations . 
In addition , the United States must reduce its budget deficit and foreign nations need to provide stimulus to their domestic economies , Volcker said . 
`` We need time for those actions and the earlier depreciation to work their effects , '' he said . 
BUNDESBANK RETAINS MONEY SUPPLY POLICY . 
Bundesbank council member Lothar Mueller said the bank has not given up its money supply policy and that restraining money supply growth does not always mean pushing up interest rates . 
Mueller said in an article for the Boersen Zeitung financial daily that a monetary policy which took into account exchange rate expectations and capital flows could not be confused with an exchange rate oriented policy . 
The article followed international press speculation that the Bundesbank had abandoned money supply targetting in favour of an exchange rate policy . 
Mueller , a member of the Bundesbank council in his position as president of the regional state central bank in Bavaria , noted that the Bundesbank 's decision in January to cut leading interest rates amid continuing strong monetary growth had led some people to think it was dropping monetary targetting . 
`` Simply to ignore the external economic context would be risky and dangerous for monetary policy , '' he explained . 
Mueller said the cuts in official interest rates had put an end to interest rate speculation . 
The Bundesbank could now assume that upward pressure on the mark would ease and currency inflows slow down . 
Lower money market rates , achieved by widening short and long term interest rate differentials , also encouraged investors to re-invest funds parked in liquid accounts , Mueller said . 
The measures therefore aimed clearly at bringing monetary growth back onto the desired path , he said . 
`` Finally , of course , and there is no need to keep this quiet , the cut in interest rates was also in line with the changed economic situation of the last few months , '' he added . 
`` All in all , the Bundesbank in no way abandoned its money supply policy with the January discount rate cut , despite suppositions to the contrary , '' Mueller said . 
`` Keeping money supply developments in check is not always synonymous with raising interest rates , especially when excessive liquidity due to inflows from abroad , rather than growth in bank credits , is the cause of rising monetary holdings of non-banks , '' Mueller said . 
Now that West Germany no longer ran large external deficits other concepts were needed for monetary policy . 
Mueller said it would be both difficult and dangerous for monetary policy to pursue a specific mark exchange rate . 
In any case , the exchange rate partly depends on U.S. Currency and budgetary policy and the U.S. Economy , he said . 
But an exchange rate orientation would also mean the end of a strict stability policy because both interest rates and liquidity would be affected by required currency intervention and could no longer be steered autonomously by the Bundesbank . 
Even interest rates are not in the centre of the Bundesbank 's considerations , but reflect competition and other market conditions , Mueller said . 
A cut in bank liquidity will not directly influence central bank money stock , the Bundesbank 's main money supply indicator . 
This does not reflect banking liquidity , but the liquidity of industry and households which can not be directly reached with the Bundesbank 's instruments , Mueller said . 
The less dependent non-banks are on bank credits , the harder it is to steer money supply . 
This has increasingly been the case recently , because non-banks have received considerable sums from current account surpluses and capital imports . 
`` If the Bundesbank had tried to brake the money supply rise with higher interest rates , as would have been appropriate if credit was growing excessively , it would not only have missed its target but probably even set off further inflows , '' he said . 
Mueller said growth in money supply was still too high . 
In the last three months money stock grew at an annual rate of seven pct , down from 10 pct in the previous quarter . 
The growth curve has therefore come closer to the three to six pct 1987 target corridor for central bank money stock growth , pointing to the success of the current policy , he said . 
But high monetary stocks can be a warning sign and there should be no change in priorities . 
`` Monetary policy must be first and foremost stability policy and successful stability policy is money supply policy -- nothing else , '' he said . 
TAIWAN PASSES ON U.S. CORN , WILL RETENDER . 
Taiwan passed on its tender overnight for 25,000 tonnes of U.S. corn and 49,000 tonnes U.S. sorghum , private export sources said . 
Taiwan will retender for the corn , for May 15-30 shipment if via the Gulf , or June 1-15 via Pacific northwest , on March 6 , but has not rescheduled a tender for sorghum , they said . 
VOLCKER URGES GREATER EXCHANGE RATE STABILITY . 
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said international policymakers should make improving the stability of exchange rates a major priority . 
In testimony before a Senate Banking subcommittee , Volcker said he does not have any specific proposals for improving exchange rate stability , but thought it was worthy goal . 
`` I do think we ought to be thinking about and working toward greater exchange rate stability , '' Volcker said . 
`` I think that the objective of greater exchange rate stability ought to loom larger among our various policy priorities . '' 
ITALY SAYS G-7 GIVES CHANCE TO VERIFY TOKYO ACCORD . 
This week 's Group of Seven -LRB- G-7 -RRB- meeting in Washington provides an opportunity to verify an accord reached at the Tokyo summit last May to include Italy and Canada in Group of Five -LRB- G-5 -RRB- talks on management of the international monetary system and related issues , the Italian Treasury said . 
It said in a statement the G-7 meeting , which Italy plans to attend , will provide a forum for considering the Tokyo accord in the light of events in Paris in February this year . 
On February 22 , Italy boycotted a meeting in Paris of its G-7 partners - the United States , Japan , West Germany , France , Britain and Canada - after being excluded from an earlier session of talks involving G-5 members . 
Today 's statement from the Italian Treasury said - `` Nobody denies the existence of G-5 but we should like it to be remembered that the Tokyo accords provided for the enlargement of the group to Italy and Canada whenever `` the management or the improvement of the international monetary economic policy measures are to be discussed or dealt with . ' '' 
Italy refused to attend the Paris G-7 meeting on the grounds that G-5 , grouping the United States , Japan , West Germany , France and Britain , had reduced Italy 's role to rubber stamping agreements already taken . 
The Italian Treasury said today that Italy was `` certain that this time incidents would not occur . '' 
But it said it would be opportune to look in depth at the role and the procedures of G-7 in relation to those of G-5 . 
BANGLADESH PASSES ON TENDER FOR SOFT WHEAT . 
Bangladesh passed on its weekend tender for 100,000 tonnes of optional origin soft wheat , private export sources said . 
KUWAIT SAID SEEKING FOREIGN PROTECTION FOR OIL . 
Kuwait has asked at least four countries , including the United States , Soviet Union , Britain and China , for temporary use of their flags or tankers to protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf , Reagan Administration officials said . 
The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new `` Silkworm '' missiles at superpower flags . 
The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the mouth of the gulf . 
`` They -LRB- the Kuwaitis -RRB- have also asked Britain , China and possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to carry their oil , '' one of the administration officials , who asked not to be identified , told Reuters . 
The United States is considering the request to temporarily transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration , but such a move could create insurance and other problems , the officials said . 
U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S. offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the gulf , where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping . 
ROLLS APPROACHES FLOAT WITH PROFITS SET TO RISE . 
State-owned engine maker < Rolls Royce Plc > launches its prospectus for privatisation tomorrow with many analysts forecasting higher profits this year . 
But it is likely to miss contracts to power the proposed < Airbus Industrie > A340 aircraft . 
The company 's so-called `` pathfinder prospectus '' gives all the details of its stock market flotation except for the price at which shares will be offered . 
Last month , the company announced that pretax profits rose in 1986 to 120 mln stg from 81 mln the year before . 
Brokers Barclays de Zoete Wedd , BZW , sees 155 mln profit for 1987 . 
Analyst Tim Harris of Phillips and Drew said rising profits and a low tax charge would be offset by the fact that Rolls operated in a sector which traditionally attracted low ratings . 
Assuming the company was valued at around eight times earnings , this would give a selling price valuing it at about 1.2 billion , though he said the recent good performance of the aerospace sector could nudge this figure upwards . 
BZW is currently forecasting a higher sale price at between 1.5 billion and 1.7 billion . 
The price will be increased by it being likely to have much of its debt wiped off by a government anxious to assure the company 's health when it has to fend for itself . 
Rolls was rescued from bankruptcy and taken into state ownership in 1971 . 
When the government announced the sale , it said it would inject permanent capital equivalent to net debt -- around 250 mln stg at end-1986 -- into the company . 
Analysts noted this was necessary to ensure Rolls a credit rating to match those of its main competitors such as General Electric Co < GE.N > and United Technologies Corp 's < UTX.N > Pratt and Whitney unit . 
PORK CHECKOFF REFUNDS LESS THAN EXPECTED . 
The National Pork Board announced at the American Pork Congress convention in Indianapolis that refunds under the legislative checkoff program are running less than expected . 
The Board oversees collection and distribution of funds from the checkoff program that was mandated by the 1985 farm bill . 
Virgil Rosendale , a pork producer from Illinois and chairman of the National Pork Board , said over 2.2 mln dlrs was collected in January and refunds are running almost nine pct , considerably less than expected . 
`` We believe that this indicates good producer support for the new checkoff . 
We 're getting good compliance from markets , from packers and from dealers , '' Rosendale said . 
VOLCKER SEES DOLLAR AS FACTOR IN MONETARY POLICY . 
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said the performance of the dollar in exchange markets could be a factor in the U.S. central bank 's decisions on monetary policy . 
`` The performance of the dollar in the exchange market might become a factor bearing on our provision of reserves , '' Volcker said in testimony to the Senate Banking Committee . 
He said that fiscal policy changes in the United States , Germany and Japan would be more important that intervention to instill confidence in current exchange rate levels . 
SOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCED-USDA . 
Despite earlier optimistic indications , the South African corn crop is at a critical stage in its development and recent reports of heat stress could reduce production and therefore exportable supplies , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . 
In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains , the department said South Africa 's corn exports in the 1986 -LRB- Oct-Sept -RRB- season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes , up 40 pct from the previous year . 
The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a period of severe droughts , which at one point required South Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983 , it said . 
Since those imports in 1983 , the U.S. has been facing increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan . 
But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available supplies , purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated , the department said . 
FED EXPECTED TO SET CUSTOMER REPURCHASES . 
The Federal Reserve is expected to intervene in the government securities market to supply temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase agreements , economists said . 
They said the Fed is expected to execute anywhere from 1.5-2 .0 billion dlrs of customer repos to offset seasonal pressures on bank reserves . 
Federal funds , which averaged 6.20 pct yesterday , opened at 6-1 pct and remained there in early trading .

CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS . 
Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings , prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets . 
Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program . 
That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low . 
Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage , but they have no price guarantees . 
With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal , traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans , even though the new crop soybean ratio of 2.9  1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances . 
An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop , means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized , traders said . 
Here too , acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats , due to the more attractive deal from the government , they added . 
Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago , which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton . 
One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans , which are easier to grow , one commercial trader said . 
VOLCKER SEES TIGHT POLICY HURTING INVESTMENT . 
Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker said a restrictive monetary policy would be damaging to investment and that a better course would be to restrain spending . 
`` A restrictive monetary policy would hit investment . 
You do n't want to put interest rates up unless you have to , '' Volcker told the Senate Banking Committee . 
`` That is not a constructive way to proceed , '' he said . 
Volcker said that given a choice between squeezing the budget deficit or squeezing investment , he would favor squeezing the budget deficit . 
In response to a question about banks , Volcker said he would be pleased if Congress decided to give banks a tax writeoff as an incentive for them to take greater reserves against loans to debtor countries . 
`` If you give a tax writeoff for reserving against loans , then we will see more reserving and that would make me happy , '' Volcker told Committee Chairman Sen William Proxmire -LRB- D-Wisc -RRB- . 
U.S. CONGRESS TO LOOK AT SOIL PROGRAM EXEMPTIONS . 
The Senate Agriculture Committee is expected to take up a bill tomorrow that would exempt from government conservation regulations those farmers who have rotated alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes with row crops , committee staff said . 
Under current so-called `` sodbuster '' law , farmers who planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highly erodible land in the years 1981 through 1985 lose federal farm program benefits if they produce a row crop on that land in later years . 
Sen. Edward Zorinsky -LRB- D-Neb . -RRB- 
, sponsor of the measure , said recently that those crop rotating practices resulted in less erosion than the practices of many farmers who produced strictly row crops .

GERMAN LONG-TERM CAPITAL INFLOW SLUMPS IN FEBRUARY . 
The inflow of long-term capital into West Germany slumped to 606 mln marks in February from January 's record 11.91 billion , with foreign purchases of German bonds and shares declining sharply , the Bundesbank said . 
While foreigners bought only four billion marks worth of German bonds in February after 13 billion in January , they sold a net 500 mln marks in shares and promissory notes of public authorities after sales worth 300 mln in January . 
With German investors ' purchases of foreign securities steady around 1.3 billion marks , only 2.2 billion marks were imported through securities transactions , after 11.2 billion . 
Direct investment abroad led to a capital outflow of 1.60 billion marks in February after 2.83 billion in January . 
There was a deficit of 8.14 billion marks in the short-term capital account after a surplus of 194 mln in January . 
Banks alone exported some 8.6 billion marks in funds while domestic companies increased their short-term financial assets abroad by 700 mln . 
But public authorities received some one billion marks from abroad , the Bundesbank said in a statement . 
Combining long and short term capital outflows , West Germany recorded a net outflow of 7.53 billion marks in February against a net inflow of 11.91 billion in January . 
The Bundesbank confirmed the German trade surplus widened to 10.45 billion marks in February from January 's 7.20 billion . 
Taking the two months together the seasonally adjusted surplus was slightly below the figure for the previous two . 
In terms of current as well as constant prices , the narrowing of the surplus was progressing , the bank said . 
Germany 's current account surplus widened to 6.63 billion marks in February from 4.79 billion in January , but was down on the 7.26 billion figure for February 1986 . 
Seasonally adjusted , the February current account surplus narrowed against January . 
While exports in February fell a half pct against the same month last year , imports fell 10-1 pct largely due to the drop in prices . 
Exports grew three pct in volume and imports two pct . 
In the balance of services , a fall in net investment income led to a 300 mln mark deficit in February after a 300 mln mark surplus in January . 
The deficit in transfer payments widened to 3.70 billion marks from 2.69 billion , largely due to a sharp jump to 2.3 billion marks from 200 mln in payments to the European Community budget . 
C.T.C. DEALER EXTENDS BID FOR CANADIAN TIRE .

The blocked bid did not include non-voting shareholders , who hold 96 pct of Canadian Tire equity . 
EC SOURCES SAY UK WHEAT PLAN YET TO BE APPROVED . 
The European Commission has not taken a decision on applications from the British government for the release of 200,000 tonnes of intervention feed wheat onto the British market in May and June , Commission sources said . 
They said last week 's cereals management committee agreed to release 70,000 tonnes of feed wheat through weekly tenders between April 14 and May 26 . 
It also indicated it planned to allow the release of another 30,000 tonnes from April 23 . 
However , it decided to leave consideration of the release of further wheat until later . 
The British government had applied for the release of a further 100,000 tonnes in both May and June from British intervention stores to prevent market prices rising . 
However , the sources said , the Commission wanted to review the market situation nearer the time before giving its approval . 
The Commission was given new powers last year to control the release of intervention cereals onto the market , the sources noted . 
Following last week 's committee meeting , the U.K. Ministry of Agriculture said the Commission had given an assurance that additional quantities of intervention wheat would be made available in May and June . 
It also said that it was envisaged that monthly releases would be at least 100,000 tonnes , depending on the state of the market . 
This lead to the widespread assumption that the Commission had actually approved the release of 300,000 tonnes during the three months of April , May and June at last week 's meeting .

ROCKWELL < ROK > SEES IMPROVEMENT IN 1987 . 
Rockwell International Corp continues to expect significant improvement in 1987 results , despite the somewhate disappointing performance of one of its business segments , President Donald Beall told Reuters . 
Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended December 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs , or 1.05 dlrs per share , compared to 125.8 mln dlrs , or 84 cts per share a year ago . 
Operating earnings , however , were off about four pct , and analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell 's Allen-Bradley unit , which has suffered from weakness in the industrial automation market . 
`` It is in a soft market now , but we are not concerned . 
It is moving forward with market development and is enhancing market share , '' Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit . 
Beall , who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology management conference , said first quarter sales for the Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier . 
He said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit on a quarterly basis . 
Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the research and development phase of government contracts should not have a major impact on Rockwell 's near-term performance . 
He noted , however , the increasing focus on cost sharing could limit technological innovation . 
`` I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of contracting approaches too early in the development stages of important military contracts , '' Beall said , adding , `` long-term , we have a very serious problem . '' 
In addition , Beall told the conference the greatest competitive threat to defense contractors is in defense electronics , due to the government 's attempt to take advantage of competitively priced products made outside the U.S.

JAPAN CUTS CHIP SUPPLY , MAY PRODUCE SHORTAGE . 
Japan is attempting to cut back semiconductor production to forstall the 300 mln dlrs in U.S. tariffs on Japanese electronic goods set to take effect April 17 , industry analysts said . 
The move is likely to create a sharp price rise and a possible shortage of the key computer components in the next few weeks , the analysts said . 
`` Prices have gone up for memory components , the mainstay of the Japanese semiconductor industry , '' analyst Drew Peck of Donaldson Lufkin and Jenrette said . 
But analysts said the price rises have been slight so far , and some questioned whether Japan would be successful in forcing Japanese companies to cut production in the long run . 
Others , however , were more optimistic , saying evidence was already in hand that Japan has cut back prodution and halted sales to the grey market , the third country brokers that sell chips at below production costs . 
`` We 've seen the grey market begin to dry up for D-RAMS , and it has virtually dried up for EPROMS , '' said Merrill Lynch analyst Thomas Kurlack of the two key memory chips used in computers . 
`` Prices are inching up and lead times on deliveries are stretching , '' Kurlack added . 
Industry analysts said Japan 's Ministry of International Trade and Industry , or MITI , had requested the cut backs in production to meet the terms of last year 's semiconductor accord with the U.S. . 
The Reagan adminsitration recently proposed tariffs on Japanese electronic goods , alleging that Japan had failed to live up to the accord and continued to dump the computer components in the U.S. market . 
But some analysts said Japan 's attempt to mollify the U.S. was a double edged sword , and might be read at a subtle form of trade retaliation for the tariffs proposed by the U.S. . 
As production in Japan is cut , these analysts argue , prices will rise in the U.S. and few American semiconductor manufactures will be able to take up the slack since most long ago exited the market for memory chips . 
U.S. computer makers that use the chips in their machines will then be pressured . 
`` The Japanese are looking for ways to reduce trade pressures from Washington , but at the same time they 're demonstating their muscle , '' analyst Peck said . 
The cut backs in Japanese production are expected to benefit U.S. chip makers . 
`` I think this could be a very important factor for U.S. semiconductor manufacturers , '' industry analyst Elliot Levine of Ladenburg Thalmann Co said . 
But analyst Peck said , `` it will take a few weeks to see whether Japan has genuinely cut production . '' 
He said Japanese manufactures were likely to view MITI 's request unfavorably because chip capacity was still high and production cut backs would lead to significant write-offs in plant and equipment .

DUTCH MONEY MARKET DEBT RISES IN WEEK . 
Loans and advances from the Dutch Central Bank to the commercial banks rose by 1.2 billion guilders to 10.7 billion in the week up to and including April 6 , the Bank 's weekly return showed . 
Paper discounted with the Bank also rose , by 477 mln guilders to 916 mln . 
These rises were balanced by a 1.6 billion guilders rise in the Treasury 's account at the Bank , made up mainly of repayments on housing loans by local authorities . 
The Treasury 's account stood at 8.1 billion guilders , the weekly return showed . 
The Bank 's gold and currency reserves rose by 484 mln to 56.89 billion guilders , while the value of non-gold holdings rose by 140 mln guilders , analysts said . 
They added that the rise in the reserves was merely the result of commercial currency transactions by the Bank . 
Call money and period tariffs were only fractionally changed this week and were seen sustaining their stable levels since no dramatic changes in the money market debt , currently around 10.25 billion guilders , are expected . 
Today call money traded between 5-3 to 5-1 pct and period tariffs all between 5-5 to 5-7 pct . 
SWAP DEALERS UNVEIL STANDARD CONTRACT . 
The International Swap Dealers Association has developed the first standard form contract for use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap transactions , said Thomas Jasper , the Association 's co-chairman . 
The contract , unveiled at a press conference , is expected to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient , he said . 
`` The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce the expense of swap documentation , '' Japsper said . 
Privately , eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all new issues eventually become part of either an interest rate or currency swap . 
An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers , usually acting through a bank middleman , agree to accept each other 's interest payments on debt securities . 
Usually , the issuer of a floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice versa . 
But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains with the original borrower . 
Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of swaps because the middleman , usually a bank , takes on some portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient capital to cushion it . 
Kenneth McCormick , a co-chairman of the ISDA and president of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc , said the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital standards for counterparties in swaps . 
The standards are part of the recently announced convergence agreement between the two countries in which regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements for institutions . 
McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a `` level playing field '' be maintained in the swaps market . 
He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more primary capital against swap transactions than is the current practice , the additional costs would have to be passed on to issuers . 
The issuers might then choose to do business with lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking rules . 
He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort . 
That code should be completed within the next few weeks , he said . 
KUWAIT ASKS TO USE FOREIGN FLAG TANKERS , U.S SAYS . 
Kuwait has asked at least four countries , including the United States , Soviet Union , Britain and China , for temporary use of their flags or tankers to protect Kuwaiti oil shipments in the troubled Persian Gulf , Reagan Administration officials said . 
The officials confirmed a New York Times report that Kuwait wants to transfer some of its oil tankers to U.S. or Soviet registration in hopes Iran would be reluctant to launch new `` Silkworm '' missiles at superpower flags . 
The United States has vowed to keep the gulf open to international oil traffic and has warned Tehran against using the Chinese-made missiles recently installed in Iran near the mouth of the gulf . 
`` They -LRB- the Kuwaitis -RRB- have also asked Britain , China and possibly some other European countries to lease tankers to carry their oil , '' one of the administration officials , who asked not to be identified , told Reuters . 
The United States is considering the request to temporarily transfer Kuwaiti ships to American registration , but such a move could create insurance and other problems , the officials said . 
U.S. defense officials told Reuters yesterday that Kuwait had decided for at least the time being not to accept a U.S. offer to use American warships to escort its tankers in the gulf , where both Iran and Iraq have been attacking shipping . 
U.S. GRAIN CERTS SAVE 50-100 MLN DLRS - AMSTUTZ . 
The use of generic commodity certificates , or `` certs , '' for fiscal years 1986-88 will save the government 50 to 100 mln dlrs , Department of Agriculture Undersecretary Daniel Amstutz said . 
Speaking at a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on the use of the certificates , Amstutz said that the issuance of 8.5 billion dlrs of certificates during fiscal years 1986-88 could result in government outlays of up to 400 mln dlrs . 
However , the use of certificates preclude the need for 450 to 500 mln dlrs in storage and handling costs , resulting in net savings for the government of 50-100 mln dlrs , he said . 
Without the use of certificates , Amstutz said nearly the entire 1985 crop which had been put under loan would have been forfeited to the Commodity Credit Corporation , CCC . 
In addition , 260 mln bushels of grain that have been redeemed from CCC inventory through certificate exchanges would have remained in the goverment inventory , he said . 
When asked to comment on a recent study by the General Accounting Office that concluded certificates result in a net cost to the government , Amstutz said , `` GAO underestimated the benefits and overstated the costs '' of the certificate program . 
Amstutz said while certificates encourage more loan entries , they also encourage heavier loan redemptions rather than forfeitures . 
GAO underestimated this net loan activity , Amstutz said . 
`` There is no question in the mind of the Department of Agriculture that these certificates have been very useful , '' Amstutz said . 
Immediate benefits of certificates include greater market liquidity , improved market price competitiveness , higher farm income , and improved debt situation and decreased carrying costs , he said . 
Certificates are an integral part of USDA 's long-range market-oriented farm policy , he said . 
Amstutz told subcommittee Chairman Rep. Dan Glickman , D-Kans. , that USDA is in the process of preparing an official response to the GAO study on certificates and will submit it to the subcommittee when completed .

U.S. URGES SURPLUS NATIONS TO BOOST GROWTH . 
Leading industrial nations will be reviewing the Paris agreement to stabilize exchange rates , foster increased worldwide growth and reduce trade imbalances but the U.S. thinks the accord has been successful so far , a senior U.S. Treasury official said . 
`` The Paris accord will be reviewed at this meeting . 
It has been successful and continues to be succesfull , '' a senior U.S. Treasury official told reporters . 
In a briefing ahead of this week 's semiannual IMF and World Bank meetings , he also said the U.S. was looking to West Germany and Japan to bolster their economic growth . 
The official said both surplus countries , like West Germany and Japan , and deficit countries , like the U.S. , agreed to play a role in bringing about more balanced economic growth . 
He reaffirmed the U.S. would press ahead with efforts to reduce its budget deficit , resist protectionism and boost U.S. competitiveness . 
The official also said that he expected trade issues , like the dispute between the U.S. and Japan over microchips , to be included in the discussions . 
The official made no direct comment on the content or schedule of forthcoming Group of Five and Group of Seven discussions . 
He said that industrial countries are concerned that the large external imbalances remain a threat to the international monetary system . 
He added that the meetings will also provide an opportunity to discuss economic policy coordination efforts . 
The official said indicators would be used to measure policy objectives of industrial countries and their economic projections . 
They would also be used to assess progress of policy goals . 
Asked whether the U.S. was proposing a new initiative regarding the indicators , the official said the issue would be reported to the Venice Summit in June . 
Monetary sources said the U.S. proposal envisages using the indicators to make policy coordination agreements , like the Paris Accord , more binding .

CONSOLIDATED-BATHURST SEES BETTER MARKET . 
-LRB- Consolidated-Bathurst Inc -RRB- said it expects improvement in the pulp and paper sector shown in the second half of 1986 to continue this year . 
The continued improvement would be due to good market demand , better product prices and high operating capacity , the company said in its annual report . 
Consolidated-Bathurst , which reported operating profit of 104 mln dlrs last year on sales of 2.02 billion dlrs , said its joint-venture acquisition of a market pulp mill at Castlegar , B.C. last year broadens its product range and will contribute to equity earnings . 
Last year 's results were up from 1985 operating profit of 80 mln dlrs and sales of 1.73 billion dlrs . 
The company said it views its near-term prospects with improved optimism . 
It said results from its Bridgewater newsprint mill in the U.K. should improve greatly this year due to stronger capacity and production and more favorable market conditions . 
It said it anticipates a return to profitability in 1987 for its Diamond-Bathurst Inc -LRB- DBH -RRB- subsidiary , which lost 6.2 mln U.S. dlrs and underwent a reorganization last year , and expects higher sales and earnings for its other North American packaging divisions . 
Consolidated-Bathurst said the outlook for its Europa Carton unit is mixed . 
It said the effect of trade disputes between the United States and the European Economic Community on the West German economy and the higher value of the mark may lead to increased costs which could not be offset by price increases . 
MORE U.S. GRAIN CERTIFICATES NEEDED , STUDY SAYS . 
More generic grain certificates should be released onto the market in order for the U.S. certificate program to have its full effect on commodities , according to a study by Sparks Commodities Inc. . 
The Agriculture Department should make grain deficiency payments and paid land diversion payments in a two-third certificate , one-third cash ratio through fiscal year 1989 , Carroll Brunthaver , president of Sparks Commodities , told a House agriculture subcommittee hearing on certificates . 
Thereafter , government payments should be issued in roughly a 50-50 split between cash and certificates , Brunthaver said . 
The Sparks study on certificates examined two possible scenarios through the 1990 growing season -- a `` zero certificate case , '' where no certificate program was assumed , and an alternative case labeled `` adequate certificate case '' in which sufficient certificates would be released so that grain prices would not be artificially supported by market shortages due to acreage reduction programs or government holdings . 
The study showed that total grain use under the adequate certificate scenario would exceed the zero certificate scenario by 11.2 pct . 
Usage would be markedly more in 1989 and 1990 , when grain usage under a certificate program was estimated to exceed the zero certificate case by 15 to 19 pct . 
For the five-year period examined , government expenditures under the adequate certificate case were 7.0 billion dlrs , or 7.5 pct less than under the zero certificate case . 
The Sparks study said that 5.1 billion dlrs , or 70 pct of those savings resulted from smaller government storage costs . 
The study also estimated that government grain stocks under the adequate certificate case would be 4.7 billion bushels below the zero certificate case at the end of the period examined . 
The Sparks study said that while certificates permit market prices to fall below loan levels , these lower prices increase commodity usage and reduce the net costs of certificates versus cash .

OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS . 
OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices , oil industry analysts said . 
`` The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought . 
They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems , '' said Daniel Yergin , director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates , CERA . 
Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets . 
`` OPEC 's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way , '' said Paul Mlotok , oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc. . 
He said the market 's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices . 
But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December . 
`` OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you can not have deemed quotas , fixed prices and set differentials , '' said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named . 
`` The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again , '' he added . 
David T. Mizrahi , editor of Mideast reports , expects OPEC to meet before June , although not immediately . 
However , he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems . 
`` They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil , but in late March and April when demand slackens , '' Mizrahi said . 
But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd . '' 
Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC 's ability to hold together prices and output . 
`` OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then , '' said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York . 
But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University 's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production . 
`` Demand for their -LRB- OPEC -RRB- oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production , '' he told Reuters in a telephone interview .

U.S. IMMIGRATION RULES SPARK CONGRESS OBJECTIONS . 
New immigration rules relating to alien farm workers and reportedly being drafted by the U.S. Agriculture Department are meeting with objections in Congress , sources on Capitol Hill said . 
USDA is drafting regulations , required by a 1986 law , that would offer amnesty to illegal aliens if they worked in the cultivation of fruits , vegetables and other perishable commodities . 
The department is considering including in its definition of perishable commodities such farm products as tobacco , hops , Spanish reeds and Christmas trees , while excluding sugar cane , the New York Times reported yesterday . 
Rep. Howard Berman , D-Calif. , would like to see the definition extended to include sugar cane , cultivation of which is `` a breeding ground for one of the scandals of the nation , '' Gene Smith , a spokesman for Berman , said . 
Livestock , dairy and poultry producers have been lobbying USDA hard to have their products covered by the amnesty provision , farm industry sources said . 
Chuck Fields of the American Farm Bureau Federation said livestock producers were `` desperate '' because they fear they will be unable to retain the many illegal aliens who have joined that industry . 
A House staff member involved in drafting the landmark 1986 immigration law who asked not to be identified said Congress did not mean to extend special amnesty provisions to workers who helped cultivate tobacco , and that inclusion of hops and Spanish reeds was `` marginal . '' 
In addition , lawmakers made it clear during consideration of the bill that lumber workers were not to be covered by the the amnesty provisions , making the inclusion of Christmas trees `` a tough call , '' this source said . 
USDA officials declined to comment on the draft regulation except to say it was subject to change before it will be released , probably some time later this month . 
While lawmakers may object to the USDA rule under consideration relating to perishable commodities , Congress is not likely to reopen debate on the controversial immigration question , congressional sources said . 
The amnesty provision specially designed for farm workers was crucial to passage of the overall immigration bill . 
Congressional staff members estimate the special farm worker amnesty provision would apply to between 250,000 to 350,000 aliens . 
The law would allow eligible farm workers who worked for 90 days during the year ending May 1 , 1986 , to apply for temporary , then permanent , resident status . 
JAPAN FIRM DEVELOPS ULTRA HEAT-RESISTING RUBBER . 
Shin-Etsu Chemical Co Ltd said it had developed an ultra thermal resistance rubber which can be used at 250 centigrade continuously without losing its properties . 
Shin-Etsu put potential demand for the product at two tonnes a month mainly for microwave ovens and as a sealant . 
But increasing use of the product in parts attached to car engines will raise demand and the company will boost output to 10 tonnes by March 1988 from two now , he said . 
CUBA CRUDE SUGAR HARVEST FAR BEHIND SCHEDULE . 
Cuban president Fidel Castro told a Congress of the Union of Young Communists here that the production of crude sugar during the harvest still in progress is 800,000 tonnes behind schedule . 
In a speech Sunday , published in today 's official paper GRANMA , Castro said unseasonable rains since January seriously interrupted harvesting and milling operations especially in the central and western parts of the island . 
The Cuban leader said the mechanical cane harvesters scheduled to cut over 60 pct of the cane this year were particularly `` vulnerable , '' as muddy fields prevent operations . 
Neither Castro nor the Cuban press have given out figures to estimate tonnes of crude production during the present harvest or the goals for the sugar campaign . 
However , a cuban sugar official told Reuters that the country will be lucky if crude output reaches last year 's 7.2 mln tonnes . 
Output of crude for the previous 1984-85 harvest was 8.2 mln tonnes . 
The harvest was scheduled to end April 30 but due to the present shortfalls it will be extended into May and June , the official said .

B.C. RESOURCES HAS AGREEMENT ON CREDIT FACILITY . 
< British Columbia Resources Investment Corp > , earlier reporting higher full year operating losses , said it reached agreement in principle with five lenders providing for a 360 mln dlr credit facility over a four year term . 
The company said the credit facility is extendable under certain circumstances , with annual principal payments of five mln dlrs . 
The agreement is subject to certain lender approvals and completion of formal documentation . 
It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs . 
B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2 preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain suspended . 
However , payment will be made on account of the quarterly dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company 's trustee from a deposit account , B.C. Resources said . 
Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of the March 31 , 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred shareholders , with payment expected in early April to shareholders of record March 31 , the company said . 
If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout , future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co < WTC > , B.C. Resources said . 
The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia . 
B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary loss , which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and gas interests by 67 pct owned < Westar Mining Ltd > .

Gains on the sales of Westar Timber 's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss , the company said . 
The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C. Resources ' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and exposure to the fluctuating pulp market . 
It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985 , and management changes and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs .

ITALY 'S ENI TO INVEST IN VENEZUELAN PROJECTS . 
Italy 's state-owned Ente Nazionale Idrocarburi -LRB- ENI -RRB- will invest 197 mln dlrs in two joint ventures in coal and petrochemicals with Petroleos de Venezuela , S.A , ENI president Franco Reviglio said . 
Speaking at a news conference , Reviglio said the two projects will eventually bring in some 300 mln dlrs annually in foreign exchange to Venezuela and help diversify the country 's export base . 
`` Joint ventures are the principal instrument for allowing the resources of the industrialized countries to be channeled to the developing world so as to lead future growth for both , '' Reviglio said . 
ENI 's subsidiary Ecofuel will join Pequiven , the petrochemical subsidiary of PDVSA in building a 160 mln dlr plant to produce mtbe , a gasoline additive used to increase octane levels . 
The 500,000 mt per year plant will be constructed at Jose in eastern Venezuela , and fed by butane produced at PDVSA 's eastern cryogenic complex . 
ENI owns 48 pct of the joint venture company , Super Octanos , C.A. , while Pequiven has 49 pct , with the remaining three pct to be sold to private investors . 
Production is set to begin in third quarter 1989 . 
Ecofuel officials said the plant is modeled after one in Saudi Arabia . 
Another ENI subsidiary , Agip Carbone , will sign a letter of intent in Caracas tomorrow to enter a partnership with PDVSA to mine the coal deposits at guasare in western zulia state , he said . 
Feasibility studies are still being done on the carbozulia project , with a definitive accord slated for august , he added . 
Agip carbone and atlantic richfield coal , an arco subsidiary have formed a consortium which will own 48 pct of the carbozulia project , whose total cost is estimated at 500 mln dlrs , the company said . 
Agip carbone will invest 24 pct , or 120 mln dlrs , in the project , it said .

REPUBLICBANK < RPT > TO RECLASSIFY BRAZIL LOANS . 
RepublicBank Corp said it has placed 182.6 mln dlrs of all intermediate and term loans to Brazil on a non-accrual basis as of March 31 . 
It said the reclassification will reduce first quarter earnings by 2.8 mln dlrs after taxes , and 11 mln dlrs after taxes for all of 1987 , if Brazil does not change its position of a moratorium on interest payments . 
RepublicBank also said its net income for the first quarter is expected to be about 10.4 mln dlrs or 30 cts a share on a fully diluted basis . 
In the year-ago first quarter the company earned 23.1 mln dlrs or 75 cts a share . 
The company also said its first quarter results are expected to include a provision for loan losses of 55 mln dlrs , about 20 mln dlrs over net loan-charge-offs of about 35 mln dlrs . 
It said the provision will increase loan losses to about 328 mln dlrs or 2.2 pct of loans . 
RepublicBank , with total assets of about 21 billion dlrs , announced in December an agreement with InterFirst Corp < IFC > to form First RepublicBank Corp. . 
If the merger is approved by regulatory agencies and stockholders , it would create the 12th largest bank holding company in the United States . 
SUPPLIES , MIDEAST TENSION FUEL GAINS IN OIL . 
Petroleum futures rallied today in a market that was expecting declines in domestic supplies and became further unsettled by escalated Mideast fighting . 
Crude oil , gasoline and heating oil all posted gains on the New York Mercantile Exchange , with crude oil prices matching life-of-contract highs . 
Crude for delivery in May closed 17 cents higher at 18.84 dlrs a barrel . 
`` Crude futures could jump above 19 dlrs a barrel but will not remain there long if products are not strong , '' Robert Murphy , account executive at E.F. Hutton , said . 
Traders said prices were supported by anticipation that the American Petroleum Institute would report a decline in domestic inventories of petroleum products in a weekly report . 
Traders said prices also were supported by an escalation in the Iran-Iraq war , with the Iranians reportedly launching a new offensive against Iraqi positions , and Iraq attacking offshore oil fields and an oil export depot . 
Buying by speculators continued to prompt gains in gold and silver futures on the Commodity Exchange in New York . 
Gold prices retreated at midday , but rallied before the close with support from the silver market , which was approaching two-year highs , traders said . 
Soybean futures posted strong gains on the Chicago Board of Trade , while corn and wheat were mostly higher . 
Traders said cash sales have been slow in the country , and the soybean harvest in Brazil has been delayed by rain , which is limiting supplies . 
In addition , the Agriculture Department last week projected a substantial drop in soybean acreage this year . 
Monday 's report that the USDA inspected 46 mln bushels of corn for export last week was unexpectedly high and , coupled with a lack of farm sales , provided support for the corn market , traders said . 
Live hogs and frozen pork bellies rallied on the Chicago Mercantile Exchange , while cattle ended lower . 
Live hogs pushed ahead on a lack of supplies because many farmers are turning their attention to spring planting rather than marketing livestock , traders said , noting that cash sales have been lighter than expected this week . 
The lack of marketing also has supported pork bellies , but prices drifted lower for moderate losses in nearby months as speculators sold contracts to take profits , traders said . 
Cattle prices closed lower but continued to show strength related to tight supplies . 
Prices pushed ahead to new contract highs , extending gains past three-year peaks set Monday , as tight supplies forced meat packers to bid aggressively for available animals . 
However , some traders sold contracts to take profits after the extended rally , which has seen the April delivery contract soar to 69.90 cents a pound from 56 cents a pound at the start of the year . 
New York coffee futures closed higher on trade talk Brazil would not be an aggressive seller near term , analysts said . 
TORCHMARK < TMK > AUTHORIZES STOCK REPURCHASE .

SOUTHERN TEXAS GRAIN DIFFERENTIALS ADJUSTED . 
Posted county prices in 99 southern Texas counties have been changed to reflect only one market differential instead of the usual two-terminal market pricing system , a senior Agriculture Department official said . 
Interior grain and soybean prices in the affected counties will now be based solely against the Texas Gulf . 
Prior to the change , county prices were also priced against the Amarillo market . 
The changes were made to better reflect local market conditions , said Ralph Klopfenstein , deputy administrator for commodity operations at USDA . 
`` The Texas Gulf has always been the dominant market in those counties . 
Amarillo never became effective for that area , '' Klopfenstein told Reuters .

The transaction was opposed by a group of Portsmouth investors who wanted the bank to remain independent , according to press reports . 
EGYPT SAID TO CANCEL PL480 SOFT WHEAT TENDER . 
Egypt has cancelled its Export Bonus tender for 200,000 tonnes of soft red winter wheat for May-June shipment after failing to bid a price acceptable to USDA , private export sources said . 
DOE RECOMMENDS SPECIAL UNIT TO ENRICH URANIUM . 
Energy Secretary John Herrington told Congress that a federally chartered corporation would be the best way to manage and operate the government 's uranium enrichment program . 
He said in a letter to Congressmen that unless the program , now run by the Energy Department , is improved , sales worth five billion dlrs could be lost between 1990 and 2000 . 
The program now has annual commercial sales of about one billion dlrs and holds 50 pct of the free world market for enrichment services . 
A department official said the world market for enriched uranium for reactors for power utilities is increasingly competitive and private entity could better tap it . 
The Administration 's plan to spin off the department 's uranium enrichment operation is in line with it effort to reduce the federal government 's role in areas where it feels private enterprise could be more efficient . 
JORDAN BOOSTS BIDS IN EXPORT BONUS WHEAT TENDER . 
Jordan has boosted its bids for U.S. soft and hard wheat under Export Bonus , private export sources said .

ALLEGHENY < AG > PREFERED SHAREHOLDERS FILE SUIT . 
Allegheny International Inc , which has agreed to a merge with a jointly-formed First Boston Inc affiliate in a deal worth 500 mn dlrs , said shareholders of its preferred stock have filed a class action complaint against the company . 
The complaint alleges , among other things , that the company and its board agreed to pay First Boston an illegal seven mln dlr topping fee if it received a higher offer for the company prior to the buyout . 
The suit contends that this fee hampers Allegheny 's ability to attract other offers or take other actions that would benefit holders of preferred stock . 
The complaint also alleges federal securities laws violations and breach of fiduciary duty . 
The suit requests an injunction against proceeding with the pending offer being made by Sunter Acquisition to acquire Allegheny . 
Sunter Acquisition Corp and Sunter Holdings Corp were formed by First Boston and Allegheny . 
Allegheny said it and the Sunter concerns intend to vigorously defend the complaint 's charges . 
The complaints were filed by Robert Moss and other parties who are believed to own about 230,000 shares of Allegheny 's preferred stock . 
CANADIANS URGE EXEMPTION FROM U.S. TRADE BILL . 
A group of Canadian lawmakers from Ontario today asked their U.S. counterparts to exempt Canada from the mandatory trade retaliation provisions in a major trade bill being considered by the U.S. Congress . 
At a meeting of the Northeast-Midwest Coalition , an organization of U.S. legislators , David Cooke , chairman of the Ontario Parliament 's Select Committee on Economic Affairs , said the exemption would help trade relations . 
The trade legislation to be considered by the full House in late April would require President Reagan to retaliate against foreign unfair trade practices unless the trade actions would harm the U.S. economy . 
Currently , Reagan can reject trade sanctions on any grounds . 
Cooke , a member of the Liberal party , told the U.S. congressmen , `` I can understand -LRB- the trade bill -RRB- . 
I think it has to do with concerns you have with the other parts of the world . '' 
`` I would suggest to you that we are your best friends . 
You do not have those concerns with Canada and you should sincerely consider exempting our country from that bill , '' he added . 
Canada is the United States ' largest trading partner , with two-way trade more than 113 billion dlrs in 1985 , according to the coalition . 
But the U.S. ran up a 23 billion dlr deficit in manufactured goods that year compared to a 14 billion dlr surplus in services trade with its neighbour .

JAPAN SEEKS TO STRENGTHEN PARIS CURRENCY ACCORD . 
Japan will seek to strengthen the Paris accord on currency stability at the meeting of the group of seven leading industrial nations tomorrow , Japanese officials said . 
However , the officials travelling with Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa and who asked not to be identified , would not provide any details of how they wanted the accord , which was signed by the six leading industrial democracies in February , to be strengthened . 
Currency target zones , or reference ranges , will not be discussed at the G-7 meeting which is scheduled for tomorrow , the Japanese officials said . 
The meeting , which is being held in conjunction with this week 's International Monetary Fund Bank sessions , will reaffirm the currency pact and there is no need for changing the language used in the Paris accord , the officials said . 
Miyazawa met with U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker early in this afternoon and discussed the dollar exchange rates , officials said , but they declined to disclosed the details of that discussion . 
The Japanese officials also declined to detail what Miyazawa and Baker discussed on the subject of greater joint intervention in currency markets to stabilize the dollar or on independent American intervention . 
The officials said such a money market action to stabilize the dollar is not only for the benefit of Japan , which is suffering from a sharp appreciation in its currency , but also for the benefit of the United States as well . 
As to U.S. urgings for Japan to take steps to boost its domestic demand to reduce its trade surplus , Japan will explain economic measures to the G-7 , the officials said . 
However , Miyazawa failed to outline the size of the Japanese economic package in his meeting with Baker today because the Japanese 1987 budget has not been authorized by the Diet , or parliament , despite the new fiscal year which started April one , the officials said . 
Japan 's ruling liberal democratic party revealed its own economic package today calling for more than 5,000 billion yen in additional spending . 
TCW CONVERTIBLE SECURITIES < CVT > SETS DIVIDEND .

The company made its initial public stock offering March five . 
CURRENCY FUTURES TO KEY OFF G-5 , G-7 MEETINGS . 
News of an agreement among G-5 and G-7 finance ministers meeting in Washington this week will be key to the direction of currency futures at the International Monetary Market , but any such agreement will need to go beyond the Paris accord to stem the recent rise in futures , financial analysts said . 
`` If they -LRB- the finance ministers -RRB- give the market something really new to look at -- that is , some package that goes beyond the Paris agreement -- you could have a real boost in the dollar , '' said Shearson Lehman Brothers analyst Anne Mills . 
On the other hand , `` anything neutral would tend to be bearish for the dollar , '' Mills said . 
Traders and analysts agree a simple reaffirmation of the Paris accord will not be enough to halt the decline in the dollar , nor will central bank intervention . 
`` A lot of people are looking for a reason to buy currencies and sell the dollar , '' said one trader for a large retail firm on the floor of the IMM . 
`` If there is no concrete resolution , they will be looking to sell the dollar , possibly down to the 1.80 mark level , '' he said . 
Technically , most currency futures are poised for another rise , said Smith Barney Harris Upham analyst Craig Sloane . 
Sloane noted that June yen futures set a new contract high on Tuesday and closed at its best level ever , while June sterling set a new contract high on Monday . 
`` Everything seems to be coming to a head right now and you do n't need much to get things rolling , '' Sloane said . 
In particular , the June Canadian dollar , for which Sloane recently put out a buy recommendation , has hovered in a range between 0.7600 and 0.7660 in recent weeks , forming a triangle on the charts from which it may soon break out on the upside . 
A close above the contract high of 0.7665 would signal a breakout , Sloane said , and would likely mean the nearby Canadian dollar contract would extend its advance to near the 0.7800 level . 
June Canadian dollar closed at 0.7656 Tuesday . 
Mills noted , however , that interest rate differentials between Canadian securities and U.S. securities have narrowed dramatically recently , with yields on 10-year Canadian bonds only about 80 basis points above U.S. 10-year notes . 
What has helped the Canadian currency , she noted , is an increasing proportion of foreign funds flowing into the Canadian equity market , particularly from Japanese investors . 
Other analysts , however , said currency futures may be near the top of their long-term rally . 
`` Something will be done at the -LRB- G-5 and G-7 -RRB- meeting to calm people , '' said David Horner of Merrill Lynch Economics . 
The Paris accord has pretty much fixed where major European currencies will trade , Horner said . 
But sterling futures may still make another run for new highs , up to 1.6300 to 1.6500 dlr in the June contract , on the positive atmosphere that will prevail before British elections and possibly another interest rate cut , Horner said . 
The June British pound closed at 1.6080 on Tuesday . 
Horner said that new boundaries for the trading range of the yen are likely to come out of the G-5 and G-7 meetings . 
The most likely range will be a bottom for the dollar between 140 to 142 yen per dollar and a top near 150 to 152 yen , Horner said . 
In yen futures , the bottom of the dollar 's range would be equivalent to 0.007100 to 0.007150 in the June contract . 
June yen closed at 0.006913 on Tuesday . 
If such a range does emerge from the meetings , `` we will have one more rally in the yen , '' Horner said . 
SENATE 'S PROXMIRE URGES CURBS ON TAKEOVERS . 
Senate Banking Committee chairman William Proxmire called for curbs of hostile corporate takeovers and new restrictions on risk arbitrageurs . 
`` At the very least , it is high time that we require all risk arbitrageurs to register seperately and specifically with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that we consider precluding brokerage firms and their employers from investing in , or owning any securities issued by , third party risk arbitrage operations , '' Proxmire said at the start of a hearing on corporate takeovers . 
`` A burning issue must be whether there ought to be a complete seperation in the future of risk arbitrage and investment banking , '' Proxmire said . 
He said he was concerned that hostile takeover attempts were hurting the economy , a view shared by corporate executives who tesitified at the hearing . 
`` I believe that takeovers have become so abusive and so tilted in favor of the financial buccaneers that remedial action is required , '' USX Corp chairman David Roderick said . 
`` For Congress to allow the takeover game to continue unchecked , would be economic suicide , '' Champion International Corp chairman Andrew Sigler added . 
POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL . 
Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth . 
In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here , Poehl said `` It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit . '' 
He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation , inflation and more depreciation if it took that route . 
Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy , accelerating tax cuts , cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth . 
He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year , but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament . 
But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark , he said . 
Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product , so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home . 
`` A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth , '' he said . 
Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors , including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade , had given some extra leeway . 
But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy . 
The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct , not the reported negative inflation rates last year , and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments . 
`` For the time being , we will have to focus our policy more on the external side , and we can live with a more expansionary money supply . 
But we must be very careful , '' he said . 
He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan 's trade surpluses , which affected European countries as well as the United States . 
Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries , saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated . 
All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level , and that further changes would damage growth , he said . 
`` This was a remarkable change in attitude , especially on the part of our American colleagues , '' he said . 
But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar 's value could overshoot . 
N.Z. UNEMPLOYMENT RATE 3.9 PCT IN DECEMBER QUARTER . 
New Zealand 's unemployment rate was 3.9 pct of the workforce in the quarter ended December 31 , unchanged from a revised 3.9 pct -LRB- preliminary 3.8 pct -RRB- in the previous quarter but slightly above 3.8 pct in the year-earlier quarter , the Statistics Department said . 
The Department , citing the Household Labour Force Survey , said in a statement the number of unemployed in October - December 1986 was 61,500 against 60,500 in the September quarter and 60,500 a year earlier .

SPAIN TO LAUNCH EXPORT DRIVE . 
Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European Community levels , director-general of the INFE export institute , Apolonio Ruiz Ligero , said . 
`` The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now , '' he said . 
`` This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy , which have a similar productive structure , '' he said . 
The plan calls for providing soft loans , tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain 's presence in international trade fairs . 
Consumer goods such as fashion and wine , as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted . 
Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20 billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan , while the government 's development aid fund -LRB- FAD -RRB- would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant . 
The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year . 
Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand , which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985 . 
He added that 80 pct of Spain 's exports went to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development -LRB- OECD -RRB- countries . 
The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the Community rose seven pct last year . 
The government plans to concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S. `` The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of EC competition , '' he said . 
He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand , while turning their backs on foreign markets . 
`` They have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation , '' he said . 
`` Foreign companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and it is it vital to secure a market share abroad . ''

AUSTRALIAN UNIONS LAUNCH NEW SOUTH WALES STRIKES . 
Australian trade unions said they have launched week-long strikes and other industrial action in New South Wales -LRB- NSW -RRB- to protest against new laws that would reduce injury compensation payments . 
Union sources said talks with the state government broke down last night , but the two sides are scheduled to meet later today in an attempt to find a compromise . 
Rail freight and shipping cargo movements in the country 's most populous state were the first to be affected , and union officials said almost every business sector will be hit unless there is a quick settlement . 
The state government recently introduced a new workers ' compensation act which would cut the cash benefits to injured workers by up to a third .

VEREINS - UND WESTBANK TO REORGANIZE NETWORK . 
und Westbank AG < VHBG.F > plans to streamline its branch network to improve its distribution of financial services , management board member Eberhard-Rainer Luckey said . 
He told a news conference on 1986 results that branches in Hamburg and Schleswig-Holstein would be merged or closed , a branch in Frankfurt opened and that the bank was considering opening a branch in London . 
Luckey said the bank 's total operating profits rose nearly 29 pct in 1986 . 
Parent bank net profit rose to 47.7 mln from 42.2 mln and the dividend remained unchanged at 12 marks . 
The group balance sheet , including for the first time VereinWest Overseas Finance -LRB- Jersey -RRB- , rose 9.2 pct to 17.9 billion marks , Luckey said . 
The parent bank balance sheet rose 89 mln marks to 13.2 billion , while business volume was almost unchanged at 14.8 billion . 
Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion while loans to companies rose seven pct . 
Foreign business and securities trading turnover also increased . 
Higher earnings from trading on the bank 's own account contributed to record operating profits . 
Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1 mln marks to 381.6 mln . 
Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to 156.7 mln , Luckey said . 
Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in West German foreign trade but earnings were still satisfactory . 
The bank 's exposure in Latin America was less than two pct of its total foreign credit and in Africa less than one pct . 
The bank continued to sell some of its exposure in 1986 , and will also continue to stock up risk provisions , he said . 
BALDRIGE CONCERNED ABOUT KOREAN DEFICITS . 
Secretary of Commerce Malcolm Baldrige expressed concern about the continuing U.S. trade deficits with South Korea and Taiwan and said that without an adjustment in exchange rates there is little likelihood of improvement . 
Speaking to the President 's Export Council , an industry advisory group , Baldrige said the trade deficit issue was under discussion with those countries . 
`` I feel that unless we see an exchange rate adjustment we probably wo n't be able to see much of a change in the large surplus that Taiwan in particular has with us , '' he said . 
In a wide-ranging discussion on U.S. trade matters , Baldrige also repeated U.S. concern about an attempted takeover by Japan 's Fujitsu company of Fairchild Computer . 
He said that the Japanese were resisting allowing U.S. companies into the giant computer business while at the same time attempting to acquire control of a U.S. company that does major computer business in the U.S. market . 
Lastly , Baldrige said that the United States was hopeful that it could complete a free market agreement with Canada by the autumn , but said major issues , including acid rain , remained unresolved .

For the year , however , the diversified holding company reported a net profit of 43.9 mln dlrs , or 56 cts a share , versus 46.4 mln dlrs , or 56 cts a share , in 1985 . 
David Murdock , chairman and chief executive officer , said , `` Both our food business and our real estate operations increased their earnings during the year -LRB- 1986 -RRB- . ''

The EC Executive Commission has backed a plan to allow member countries to ban regular leaded gasoline in a move designed to encourage use of unleaded fuel . 
It said in a statement it backed a proposal to allow EC states to ban sales of regular grade gasoline containing lead at six months notice . 
The proposal , which needs approval by EC ministers , would not force any member state to impose the ban . 
`` It 's an option , not an obligation , '' a spokesman said . 
But the Commission said imposing the ban would encourage the use of unleaded fuel , as well as making it easier for gas stations by cutting the number of types of gasoline they had to stock .

U.S. TREASURY AIDE WARNS ON INFLATION . 
Thomas Berger , Deputy Assistant Secretary of the Treasury , said that a further drop in the exchange value of the dollar could cause prices to go up and trigger inflation . 
He told a meeting of the President 's Export Council that the Japanese and the Germans have cut their profit margins to reflect recent drops in the dollar , so prices have remained much the same . 
But he added that if the dollar dropped further there could be inflation in the United States . 
Berger also said that a further devalued dollar may cause economic depressions in some U.S. trading partners , and that would not be in America 's interest because it would close those markets to U.S. goods . 
LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER . 
A leaf disease affecting seven pct of Sri Lanka 's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices , industry officials and researchers told Reuters . 
About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute -LRB- RRI -RRB- clone 103 have been hit by the fungus `` corenes pora '' which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves . 
The disease was first discovered about six months ago . 
Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes . 
Last year 's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes . 
Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken . 
`` The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease , '' an Institute spokesman said . 
Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka , east of here , to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board . 
The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares . 
The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting . 
Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones . 
Officials at yesterday 's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated . 
They declined to comment on other decisions taken . 
Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December . 
`` If there is a shortage of rubber , prices are bound to rise , '' a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said . 
Rubber prices , particularly crepe , fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March . 
The best crepe one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo , averaged 19.75 at this week 's auction . 
Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period . 
Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas . 
Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday 's auction with the supply position showing improvements . 
Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions . 
`` Some factors , like less storage space from excess stocks , meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had , '' one buyer said . 
Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month , while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem . 
European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further . 
They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas . 
`` If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late March are delayed , we would have further shortages , '' one official said . 
`` But this again could benefit prices , '' a buyer said .

GERMAN INSTITUTE SEES INFLATION RISING IN 1987 . 
The cost of living in West Germany will likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986 , when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in the first recurrence of `` negative inflation '' since the 1950s , the HWWA economic research institute said . 
The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986 cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the value of the dollar , the institute said in a report . 
The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the course of 1987 , but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the first part of 1987 . 
Provisional inflation figures for February released last week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower than in February 1986 . 
In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct against the same month a year earlier . 
The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain around 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17 dlrs per barrel . 
FED DRAFTS CURRENCY , RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE . 
The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank 's loans and other assets . 
Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England . 
The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan . 
The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps , forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments . 
Previously , the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain . 
Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank 's minimum capital needs . 
The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank 's current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure . 
The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset , which would reflect the replacement cost . 
Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking regulators . 
Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset . 
The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity . 
They ignore , for example , the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts . 
Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks , which are the principal participants in these types of activities . 
They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to compete in world financial markets . 
However , the staff concluded , `` The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations . '' 
The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market , on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs . 
Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges . 
Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules .

JANUARY CRUDE OIL MOVEMENTS FALL SEVEN MLN TONS . 
Worldwide spot crude oil movements fell to 30.07 mln long dwt in February from 37.25 mln tons in January and 41.44 mln in December , London shipbroker Howard Houlder said . 
The decline mainly reflected a sharp drop in movements out of the Mideast Gulf , which totalled 7.4 mln tons last month against 11.65 mln in January . 
These included shipments to western options at 2.05 mln tons against 3.59 mln previously . 
Liftings from the Gulf to eastern options fell to 4.15 mln tons from 5.94 mln and those from the Gulf to other areas dropped to 1.2 mln tons from 2.13 mln , Howard Houlder said . 
U.K.  Continent coastal movements declined sharply to 2.91 mln tons from 4.77 mln but those from the U.K.  Continent to the U.S. rose to 1.99 mln from 1.69 mln . 
EC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE . 
The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of social and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products , EC Commission sources said . 
The ministers agreed that under this `` extensification '' scheme , farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct . 
The plan would initially apply to cereals , beef , veal and wine , they added . 
Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage , while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield . 
In each case , farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC . 
The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego . 
The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment . 
It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops . 
At present such allowances are available only for livestock . 
The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques , the sources added . 
At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers . 
Andriessen did not give full details , but said member state aid would be subject to `` strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition . '' 
EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production . 
The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay `` early retirement '' pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production . 
Those who took their land completely out of farm production , rather than passing it on to their heirs , would have received more generous payments . 
Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed . 
U.S. , BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS . 
The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets , the Bank of England said . 
The plan , covering swaps , forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates , complements proposals agreed in January between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy , the proposal said . 
It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals . 
The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma . 
`` On the one hand -LRB- we -RRB- are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other hand -LRB- we -RRB- are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And U.K. Banking organisations to price ... Contracts competitively . '' 
At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures . 
In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance sheet assets , the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct , depending on the quality of the counterparty , the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract , the plans showed . 
The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts . 
They would , however , be reflected in the assignment of risk weights . 
The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S. And U.K. Governments or , in the U.S. , By domestic national government agencies , the proposals showed . 
The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges . 
It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to `` net '' contracts -- consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream . 
It recognised that `` such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation , '' and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account .

< NOVA > WINS GOVERNMENT OKAY FOR HUSKY < HYO > DEAL . 
Nova , the Canadian company that owns 56 pct of Husky Oil Ltd , said it received government approval for a transaction under which < Union Faith Canada Holding Ltd > would buy a 43 pct stake in Husky .

FROST NOT EXPECTED TO DAMAGE POLAND 'S WHEAT . 
Poland 's winter wheat is likely to survive recent frosts but the impact of the cold will not be known until late April , the Polish meteorology institute said . 
Some varieties of winter wheat sown in Poland can survive ground temperatures as low as minus 20 degrees C , Spokesman Teresa Tomaszewska told Reuters . 
Even though an earlier thin protective layer of snow mainly melted in February , air temperatures down to minus 30 C should not be harmful , she said , but added that wheat can still be damaged by cold spells in March and April , when young shoots may be exposed to night frosts .

GREAT NORTHERN NEKOOSA < GNN > ANNOUNCES SPLIT . 
The Great Northern Nekoosa Corp said it will recommend to shareholders a two-for-one common stock split . 
The company said it will make the proposal to shareowners at its annual mmeting May 6 in Dothan , Ala. , near the company 's Great Southern Paper division operations . 
In conjunction with the stock split proposal , the shareowners will be asked to approve an increase in the authorized common stock from 60 mln to 150 mln shares , the company said .

The company said it had increased the dividend by 13 pct last December . 
Great Northern Nekoosa 's last common stock split , a three-for-two , was in December 1983 , it said . 
As of Dec 31 , 1986 , there were 26,661,770 shares of GNN common stock outstanding , according to the company .

COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S. . 
Failure of talks on re-establishing International Coffee Organization , ICO , coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States , particularly the State Department , to reassess its position , but the U.S. is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by `` objective criteria '' , U.S. officials said . 
Jon Rosenbaum , assistant U.S. trade representative and head of Washington 's delegation to the talks , told Reuters on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary . 
Rosenbaum said the United States will be `` flexible '' in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas , but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas . 
At the ICO talks major consuming nations , led by the U.S. , proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer 's recent exportable production and verified stocks , while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares . 
The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil , by far the world 's largest producer . 
Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S. customs service to monitor coffee imports , as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas . 
He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks , but `` nobody is proposing we change our position . '' 
However , other U.S. government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries , led by Brazil and Colombia , to soften the consumer position . 
`` Knowing that its next crop is fairly large , Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers , '' said one U.S. official . 
The U.S. official , who asked not to be identified , said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries , particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London . 
This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries , faced with mounting debt problems , to the U.S. State department , and to the National Security Council in the White House , for an easing of the U.S. position , U.S. officials said . 
The State department , a major player in setting U.S. coffee policy , may then face conflicting pressures , particularly from politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America , U.S. officials said . 
El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria . 
But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group , which said it would agree to objective criteria . 
There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question , U.S. officials said . 
Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions . 
In London , the U.S. was supported by the U.K. , the Netherlands , West Germany , Japan , Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria , U.S. officials said . 
This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals . 
However , U.S. sources said West Germany 's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks . 
France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks . 
A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult , although not impossible , for the U.S. to block producer plans . 
While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important , U.S. officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil 's position . 
U.S. officials blamed Brazil 's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement . 
INVESTORS HAVE 12.9 PCT OF EXOVIR < XOVR > . 
Mark Hammer , a private investor from Melville , N.Y. , and members of his family told the Securities and Exchange Commission they have acquired a total of 375,200 shares of Exovir Inc , or 12.9 pct of the total outstanding . 
Hammer said his group has been accumulating Exovir stock since Oct 28 , 1985 for investment purposes and may buy more shares or sell all or part of his current stake . 
While he said he has no intention of seeking control of the company , Hammer said that because of his `` extensive business experience '' and his interest in Exovir stock , he may be `` invited '' to become a member of the company 's board . 
TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST . 
Torrential rains throughout Argentina 's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday , trade sources said . 
Sunflower , maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected , they said . 
But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May . 
The rains did no damage to maize , sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year 's harvest . 
Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires , with the heaviest rains in the province 's western sectors , between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba , 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa , 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe , 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios , five and 40 mm in Misiones , and five and 50 mm in San Luis . 
No rain was recorded in Corrientes , Chaco and Formosa . 
Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week 's estimates . 
Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe , though slowly . 
Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area , compared to five to seven pct last week . 
Total maize area planted for the 1986 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares , or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985 harvest . 
Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes , or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates , or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year 's volume , according to official figures . 
The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area . 
Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest , down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year 's figure of 3.14 mln hectares . 
Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes , which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985 harvest . 
Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area , which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985 harvest . 
Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes , or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985 . 
Soybean production , by contrast , is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes , which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year 's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes , according to private estimates . 
Official figures put last year 's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes . 
Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition , helped by abundant rains and high temperatures . 
Total soybean-planted area for the 1986 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares , up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year 's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares .

EC APPOINTS NEW TRADE CHIEF . 
The European Community Commission today appointed its chief spokesman , Hugo Paemen , as its top official in charge of multilateral trade negotiations , a Commission spokesman said . 
Paemen , a Belgian official who had previously been chief aide to former External Affairs Commissioner Etienne Davignon , has been in his post since January 1985 . 
The spokesman said Paemen will continue as chief spokesman until the retirement on May 1 of Paul Luyten , who is now in charge of EC departments handling negotiations in the world trade body GATT , the OECD and other forums . 
U.S. SENATOR TO PROPOSE 0 FOR 1987 CROPS . 
Sen. Rudy Boschwitz , R-Minn. , said he intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers of wheat , feedgrains , cotton and rice to receive at least 92 pct of their deficiency payments , regardless of how much they planted . 
Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that applying the so-called 0 provision to 1987 crops was supported by the Reagan administration and would save approximately 500 mln dlrs , including 266 mln dlrs in corn payments , 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton . 
The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House Agriculture Committee is approved by that body . 
Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S. Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not to plant under the decoupling scheme . 
If payments are not set in advance under decoupling , market prices conceivably could rise , thereby leading to diminished deficiency payments . 
Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , D-Vt. , said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as possible on the issue , but would have to study the matter further before deciding how he would vote on it . 
INDIA BUYS UP TO 10 CARGOES SUGAR - TRADERS .

London trader E D and F Man said it sold two cargoes at 233 dlrs a tonne CIF for March shipment with an option to sell an additional two cargoes at the same price . 
Traders said at least one other international trader made a similar contract while a French house sold two cargoes at an outright price of 233 dlrs CIF without the option . 
This brought total Indian purchases to at least six cargoes with traders having options to sell another four .

TURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986 . 
Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs , well over target , but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields , Ali Tigrel , director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said . 
He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct , up from 5.1 pct in 1985 , which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand . 
Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year . 
This year 's target of 20 pct `` might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful , '' he said . 
Tigrel , whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government 's economic planning , said Turkey 's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall , originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs . 
`` We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years , '' he added . 
His comment echoed last October 's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey , which said Ankara 's case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus . 
`` In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments , we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit , '' he said . 
Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits . 
Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained . 
`` We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations , '' he said . 
It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986 . 
More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted , Tigrel said . 
Measures were being taken to encourage exports , and production incentives were being considered . 
`` We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years . 
The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned , '' Tigrel said . 
He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies , begun in 1980 , was still under way . 
Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied , but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible . 
ENERGY OIL PRODUCTION . 
Drilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last year 's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices , industry analysts said . 
Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick , heavy and expensive to extract , oil prices would have to increase to near 1985 's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling , they said . 
`` Companies will probably only drill their best prospects , '' said John Curti , an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc. . 
Few new wells now are being drilled . 
Only 33 rigs , about one-quarter of the total available , were drilling for oil onshore in California last week , compared to about 70 last year , said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services , which tracks California drilling activity . 
`` It 's in the dregs right now , '' said Bolster of the state 's drilling activity . 
Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling , said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association . 
While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year , prices eventually fell . 
Prices for California 's marker grade , Line 63 blend , have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs . 
More than half of California 's oil comes from stripper wells , those producing less than 10 barrels a day , and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract , Malmgreen said . 
`` It 's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs , '' Malmgreen said . 
Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil , and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick , heavy oil , he said . 
The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now , analysts said . 
In the heart of California 's oil patch , Kern County , which produces about two-thirds of the state 's oil , exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl . 
Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986 , compared to 137 in 1985 , according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission . 
So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled . 
`` I do n't think they 'll even get to what they did last year , '' Mitchell said . 
No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade , Mitchell said . 
Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production . 
Between February and October of 1986 , the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000 , said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission . 
In line with that decrease , California 's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level , analysts said . 
Between February and October 1986 , California 's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd , Guerard said . 
Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls , compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983 , according to the California Department of Conservation . 
`` Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels , '' Guerard said . 
STANDARD OIL < SRD > IN TEXAS NATURAL GAS FIND .

IZVESTIA SAYS SOVIET WINTER CROPS NEED RESEEDING . 
The government daily Izvestia said a considerable amount of Soviet winter crops need to be reseeded and the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes will not be easy to fulfil . 
Without giving figures , the newspaper said : `` A considerable part of the winter crops must be reseeded , but that creates extra effort in the fields in spring . '' 
The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill . 
A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in 10 years . 
`` The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes of grain is not simple , '' Izvestia said . 
This week 's sudden fall in temperatures has affected large parts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in the Ukraine , it said , adding that temperatures fell to as low as minus 30 centigrade in Byelorussia .

The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee approved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted alfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and 1985 from a federal conservation requirement . 
Sen. Edward Zorinsky , D-Neb. , said his bill would restore equity under federal sodbuster rules , which currently deny farm program benefits to farmers who , between 1981 and 1985 , planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without interrupting the plantings with a row crop . 
An official from a leading conservation group , who asked not to be identified , said the panel 's move was `` an unfortunate first action '' because it could lead to the exemption of potentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations , established under the 1985 farm bill .

OUTBOARD MARINE < OM > RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMOR . 
Wall Street traders said the stock of Outboard Marine Corp was rising on a rumor over a cable television program that Outboard is a likely takeover target of Sun Chemical Corp < SNL > . 
Outboard was up 3-1 to 34-5 . 
On Tuesday it rose 1-3 to 31-1 Tuesday . 
A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has 4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go for control of the whole company . 
An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the rumor . 
The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up to 40 dlrs a share , or for a total of 680 mln dlrs . 
A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available . 
Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan that will be triggered when a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership . 
Wayne Jones , vice president at Outboard for strategic planning , said management wants to stay independent . 
`` We are not trying to sell the company . 
We are proceeding with our strategic plans , '' he said . 
That plan includes integrating five boat companies that Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December . 
Jones said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs . 
An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a `` decent '' price for outboard . 
`` A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a share is stretching it . 
Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops , '' he said . 
Outboard , which has 17 mln shares outstanding , is in registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan Stanley Inc. . 
It makes sense , the analyst said , for Sun Chemical to strike before the offering is underway .

FRENCH WHEAT EXPORTS TO EC FALL . 
French soft wheat exports to other European Community countries fell 18 pct to 4.13 mln tonnes in the first seven months of the 1986 season to January compared with 5.04 mln in the same 1985 period , the French Cereals Intervention Office -LRB- ONIC -RRB- said . 
According to latest ONIC statistics , the main buyers were Italy with 1.89 mln against 1.63 mln in the same 1985 period , West Germany 480,450 tonnes against 717,689 , the Netherlands 462,048 -LRB- 532,299 -RRB- and Belgium 417,887 tonnes -LRB- 919,337 -RRB- . 
British and Greek imports of French soft wheat during this period were below year-ago levels . 
Between July 1 last year and January 31 , Britain bought 274,665 tonnes against 642,800 tonnes , ONIC figures showed . 
But Spanish purchases were up sharply at 258,507 tonnes against 2,751 tonnes in the same 1985 period and Portugal bought 37,599 tonnes compared with zero . 
ONIC said the drop in French exports to other Community countries was due to British competition .

ESTIMATED FRENCH BARLEY STOCKS WORRYING - ONIC . 
The size of French 1986 carryover barley stocks , estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes in 1985 is worrying , French Cereals Intervention Office -LRB- ONIC -RRB- Director Bernard Vieux said . 
He told journalists these estimates were unchanged at the end of February from the previous month while export forecasts were lowered to 4.5 mln tonnes from 5.76 mln in 1985 . 
Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are opened for French barley a large amount could be put into intervention . 
A small amount of French barley has already been put into intervention , Vieux said without detailing the amount . 
The outlook for French maize is better with 1986 exports to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000 tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in 1985 . 
The higher estimate is due to the EC Commission 's decision to hold special export tenders for French maize , he said .

S. KOREAN TRADE SURPLUS WITH U.S. SEEN FALLING . 
South Korea 's record 7.1 billion dlrs trade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as the country switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S. companies , Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said . 
He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued , and denied any plans for a `` drastic and sudden '' revaluation . 
Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities . 
Last year South Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus , including a record 7.1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlr deficit with Japan . 
Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission is looking for 2.0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S. companies , about a quarter of which represents `` transferred purchases from Japanese sources . '' 
Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are `` mainly chemicals , machinery and parts . '' 
He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S. agricultural products . 
The current mission is not involved in that area but there are plans to buy `` substantial amounts of cotton '' from the U.S. . 
He noted his country `` is clearly not as open as the American market . 
Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be , '' considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and spends six pct of its gross national product on defense .

CANADA WHEAT BOARD ADVISES CUT IN GRAIN PRICES . 
The Canadian Wheat Board has advised the federal government to sharply cut initial prices paid to farmers for their wheat , oats , and barley in the crop year beginning August 1 , a board spokesman said . 
The spokesman declined to give the size of the recommended price drops but said it would not be good news for western Canadian grain growers . 
`` They 're all lower , '' he said . 
`` This is really getting pretty serious . 
We 're talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it 's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop . '' 
Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices . 
Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board . 
If the wheat board , which markets most of Canada 's grain , obtains higher than expected prices on world markets , the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year . 
If prices are lower , the federal treasury makes up the difference . 
The final decision on the initial prices , usually made in April , rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet . 
Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts . 
But federal agricultural officials have already warned farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year . 
GATT COUNCIL DEFERS DECISION ON SEMICONDUCTORS . 
The ruling GATT Council deferred a decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a European Community complaint against the U.S. - Japanese agreement on exports of computer semiconductors . 
David Woods , spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade -LRB- GATT -RRB- , told a news briefing that the main parties would continue bilateral talks . 
This was in the hope of resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15 . 
The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips , officially known as semiconductors . 
The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to monitor prices , allowing it to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries . 
The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market . 
Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong , Canada , Switzerland , Singapore , Sweden , Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC complaint during the heated Council debate . 
Japan 's delegate , Minoru Endo , and U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were unfounded , but they were willing to continue bilateral talks .

U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels charged during the Council debate that Canada was trying to preserve domestic jobs by insisting that herring and salmon be processed at home .

COLOMBIAN INFLATION RISES 2.03 PCT IN FEBRUARY .

The rise brought year-on-year inflation to 19.77 pct compared with 23.72 pct at end-february 1986 and 21.66 pct for the year ending january 1987 . 
The government has predicted that inflation this year would be lower than in 1986 when it reached 20.9 pct . 
TALKING POINT MOTORS < GM > . 
General Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday , but analysts said GM 's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share . 
GM shares rose 3-1 to 79-1 in active trading . 
Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they differed sharply over the carmaker 's long term prospects . 
`` I 'm very positive on GM , '' said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co. `` They 're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value . '' 
However , some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share . 
After the market had closed yesterday , GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990 . 
The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares , with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day . 
The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning , and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models . 
But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive . 
`` The buyback does n't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet , '' he said , since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases . 
The stock should settle back down to around 76 , he added . 
Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988 , compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs . 
Healy 's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates , which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988 . 
Like other analysts , Healy sees GM 's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987 . 
`` On balance , GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors , '' he said . 
In late February , GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co < F > and Chrysler Corp < C > both posted increases . 
But GM said February sales showed improvement over January , adding that it expects improvement in coming months . 
Overall , GM 's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986 , analysts said . 
The numbers include imports . 
Kidder Peabody 's Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter , which will help GM finance the buyback . 
`` GM -LRB- stock -RRB- has been a real laggard and now it 's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious . 
I think there 's a major earnings surprise in the winds , '' he said . 
Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today , in part in reaction to the announced buyback , and sees GM earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988 . 
`` The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler , '' he said . 
Another positive for the stock is GM 's dividend , currently five dlrs a share annually , which gives it a higher yield than its competitors , Kirnan said . 
And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year , he predicted . 
But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said U.S. car sales will weaken , and GM 's new products , if successful , will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share . 
`` I believe their new cars will be successful , but that will only curtail losses in market share , '' which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990 , Lucky said . 
Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears . 
While he is recommending GM stock , he said results will not improve until 1988 . 
`` I 'm not looking for improvement this year . 
This is a transition year for GM , '' he said . 
Fricke , who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs , said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results . 
`` But the key thing is n't so much what they earn this year . 
It 's the momentum beyond this year that 's important . '' 
PARTNERSHIP CUTS STAKE IN ERC INTERNATIONAL < ERC > . 
Parsow Partnership Ltd , a Nevada investment partnership , said it lowered its stake in ERC International Inc to 343,500 shares or 8.3 pct of the total outstanding common stock , from 386,300 shares , or 9.3 pct . 
In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission , Parsow said it sold 42,800 ERC common shares between Jan 9 and March 2 at prices ranging from 12.125 to 14.50 dlrs each . 
The partnership said its dealings in ERC stock are for investment purposes and it has no intention of seeking control of the company .

U.K. OIL INDUSTRY SAID NOT PERMANENTLY DAMAGED . 
The U.K. Offshore oil industry has suffered from last year 's collapse in oil prices but should not sustain any permament damage , Minister of State for Energy Alick Buchanan-Smith said .

He noted , however , that oil companies were still spending six mln stg a day to maintain North Sea production .

Prices of North Sea Brent-grade crude dipped to a low of 8.50 dlrs a barrel last July from a peak of over 30 dlrs the previous November . 
They recovered to around 18 dlrs a barrel after last December 's OPEC meeting and Brent traded today around 17.15 dlrs . 
Buchanan-Smith said the U.K. Has no intention of adopting OPEC style quotas , noting that Britian is an oil-consuming as well as an oil-producing nation .

Qintex will also acquire another 2.4 mln Roach treasury shares at seven dlrs a share 12 months after closng for another 16.8 mln dlrs , H.R.S. said . 
TOTAL STILL EXPECTS 1.5 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS . 
French oil group Total Cie Francaise des Petroles < TPN.PA > is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc consolidated net loss , including minority interests , for 1986 , after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs , the company said in a communique after a board meeting here . 
In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar had caused the stock depreciation , turning a consolidated net profit , before losses on stocks , of six billion francs into a consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs . 
Earlier today Armand Guilbaud , president of Total 's refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution -LRB- CRD -RRB- Total France < RAFF.PA > , told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation . 
CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16 billion loss in 1985 . 
But its net loss last year , taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations , was 1.16 billion francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985 . 
In 1986 CRD 's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from 20.9 mln `` due to the growth in imports by independent distributors following a relaxation of regulations , '' Guilbaud said . 
The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000 this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year , under a job reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln francs , he said . 
Concerning business in 1987 , he said that `` January was a good month , but the situation deteriorated in February . ''

RESOURCE EXPLORATION < REXI > IN DRILLING PACT . 
Resource Exploration Inc said it has agreed to let < Langasco Energy Corp > drill 50 oil and natural gas wells on its Clinton Sandstone formation within its Tuscarawas and Harrison County , Ohio area of operation . 
Resource said it would receive a cash payment and an overriding royalty interest on oil and gas production from wells drilled on the property . 
Resource said gas produced from the property will be transported through its existing pipeline . 
Also , Resource said it will provide service work to complete the wells and it will operate the wells after they are completed . 
TEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS . 
Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent , saying that the ailing oilpatch can not wait for Congress to act , today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells . 
Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers . 
His proposal to revitalize Texas ' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state 's 4.6 pct severance tax . 
He said that the majority of Texas ' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production . 
Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves . 
Secondary and tertiary oil production , expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil , should also be exempted from the severance tax , Nugent said . 
His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years , or until the price of oil reaches $ 25 a barrel . 
`` We 've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow . 
I say we have waited long enough , '' Nugent said . 
`` In other words , let 's tell Washington to either lead , follow , or get out of the way . '' 
Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry .

COLOMBIA BLASTS U.S. FOR COFFEE TALKS FAILURE . 
Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last week 's International Coffee Organisation , ICO , talks on export quotas . 
`` We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible than the one of Brazil , where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions , '' Gaviria told Reuters in an interview . 
The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London . 
Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes , both from producing and consuming nations , made it impossible . 
In a conversation later with local journalists , Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences , not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries . 
He told Reuters that Colombia , because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks , would probably suffer less . 
According to Gaviria , Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports , which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country 's total export revenue . 
That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400 mln dlrs from 1986 . 
Colombia , which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the start of the current coffee year , exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985 coffee year ending last September 30 .

PACTEL < PAC > SEES EARNINGS GROWTH . 
Pacific Telesis Group chairman Donald Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs , or 5.02 dlrs per share , earned in 1986 . 
Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8 billion dlrs in 1986 , and the company expected the figure to remain flat each year through 1989 . 
He noted that all captial spending will be internally financed . 
Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific Bell operating company . 
In rates hearings before , the California Public Utility Commission , Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr revenue reduction , and due to ongoing discussions with the commission , he said the figure might even be greater . 
The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr rate hike requested for 1986 . 
Guinn said the commission found 180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations and assumptions , while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded modernization costs . 
Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether to join an international consortium that plans to lay a transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan . 
`` We have not agreed to anything , '' Guinn said , but added he would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the company would make a decision soon on participating . 
Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating companies to offer limited long distance services , Guinn said the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion . '' 
-LRB- Long distance services -RRB- is a very competitive business . 
It 's a commodity business and becoming more so , '' he said . 
`` I 'm not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that business . '' 
However , Guinn generally applauded the U.S. recommendations , saying they would give more latitude for the Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic alliances with other companies . 
He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into new areas , it is not currently involved in any acqusition talks . 
`` We do not have anything actively under consideration , '' he said .

KENYA SIGNS PACT TO ESTABLISH OWN SHIPPING LINE . 
Kenya has signed an agreement with British and German interests to establish a shipping line that will handle 40 pct of the country 's external trade , sources close to the deal said . 
The state-owned Kenya Ports Authority , KPA , signed an agreement with the Hamburg-based shipping line Unimar Seetransport to establish the Kenya National Shipping line , with an initial capital of 100 mln shillings , sources said . 
KPA will hold 70 pct of the shares in the new company . 
The line will initially charter vessels to operate services between Mombasa and the main ports of industrial Europe , but may eventually build or buy its own ships . 
The sources said it would aim to carry a large part of Kenya 's coffee and tea exports and oil and fertiliser imports . 
NEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED , DEALERS SAY . 
U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry , swap dealers said . 
After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board , dealers said that in effect , regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk . 
Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals . 
Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets , which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine . 
While no firm figures exist , dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement . 
Separately , the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding . 
Kenneth McCormick , co-chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association -LRB- ISDA -RRB- and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc , said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals . 
`` What they are proposing is really double counting , '' Patrick de Saint-Aignan , managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co , said . 
Instead , he argues , banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default . 
`` The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected , '' said a director at one U.K. merchant bank . 
`` What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now -- to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now , '' he added . 
-LRB- Adds title first paragraph -RRB- . 
Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement , such as those based in Japan , will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers . 
Indeed , regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements . 
Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger , following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed , said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules . 
Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting , that is , offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other . 
The paper said that regulatory authorities `` recognize that such arrangements -LRB- netting -RRB- may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk . '' 
Furthermore , the paper said , if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests , it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly . 
But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design . 
`` One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market . 
So we do n't know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court , '' said one bank official .

RENEWAL OF U.S.  USSR GRAIN PACT SAID UNCERTAIN . 
Prospects for renewal of the five-year U.S.  USSR grains agreement are uncertain at this point , a Soviet trade official told Reuters . 
The current trade imbalance between the United States and the Soviet Union , high U.S. commodity prices , and increased world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement next year less certain , Albert Melnikov , deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union , said in an interview . 
The current agreement expires on Sept 30 , 1988 . 
Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in 1975 . 
Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as attractive for both sides as it once was . 
`` We have had one agreement . 
We have had a second agreement , but with the second agreement we 've had difficulties with prices , '' Melnikov said . 
`` I can not give you any forecasts in response to the future about the agreement ... I do not want to speculate on what will happen after Sept 30 , 1988 , '' he said . 
Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Soviet government officials that they would be pushing for a renewal of the agreement . 
`` The situation is different in comparison to three , five or ten years ago ... We can produce more , '' he said .

LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987 . 
Liquefied natural gas imports from Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its economically feasible , U.S. industry analysts sources said . 
Youcef Yousfi , director-general of Sonatrach , the Algerian state petroleum agency , indicated in a television interview in Algiers that such imports would be made this year . 
`` Contract negotiations , filing with the U.S. government and the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay the import until 1988 , '' Daniel Tulis , a natural gas analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said . 
Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former customers , Panhandle Eastern < PEL > and Distrigas , a subsidiary of Cabot Corp < CBT > to resume LNG export , company officials told Reuters . 
A third , El Paso Gas , a subsidiary of Burlington Northern < BNI > , has expressed no interest . 
Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were feasible . 
`` On a marginal cost basis , the companies that have made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate profitably even in the current price environment , '' Frank Spadine , an energy economist with Bankers Trust , said . 
Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend higher by the end of 1987 . 
A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm prices , Shearson 's Tulis said . 
In this context , Algerian LNG import would be a source of supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production , he added . 
Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree , saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand . 
Company sources also said that any negotiations with Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market values .

MORE PRESSURE URGED FOR ASIA TO TAKE U.S. BEEF . 
Congressmen from beef producing states and representatives of the U.S. livestock industry urged the Reagan administration to press Japan and South Korea to open up their markets to imports of beef . 
Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock issues , Rep. Hal Daub -LRB- R-Nebr . -RRB- 
, said the administration should push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea . 
Daub was joined by several other lawmakers . 
U.S. assistant trade representative Suzanne Earley , replied `` we 're not going to let Japan off the hook , or Korea . '' 
She noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior Korean official last week on the beef issue , and that Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in April for discussions on farm trade issues . 
Japan maintains a quota on beef imports , set at 58,400 tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987 . 
South Korea has banned beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to U.S. pressure and allow some imports soon , industry officials said . 
In testimony today , Tom Cook , director of industry affairs for the National Cattlemens Association said `` the Congress , administration and the industry must take a strong , tough and united stand to impress the Japanese that we mean business and that we expect them to open their markets . '' 
SOUTH AFRICAN FOREIGN RESERVES UP SHARPLY IN FEB . 
South Africa 's total gold and foreign assets rose by 700 mln rand in February to 6.2 billion rand after rising by almost one billion rand in January , Reserve Bank Governor Gerhard de Kock said . 
De Kock , interviewed on state-run television , gave no breakdown of the reserves . 
He also said that to curb inflation , salary increases would have to be below the inflation rate . 
The state must set an example by keeping wage increases below the inflation rate , he said . 
Consumer prices rose by 16.1 pct in the year to January . 
MORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE . 
Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill its buying obligations under the U.S.  USSR grains agreement depends entirely on the United States , a Soviet trade official told Reuters . 
`` How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement if the United States does not want to offer us grain at competitive prices ? '' 
said Albert Melnikov , deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States . 
`` We are in the market for grains , but it is up to the United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive prices , '' he said in an interview . 
Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at prevailing market prices . 
`` We are being accused of not implementing this agreement . 
We do not consider we are at fault , '' Melnikov said . 
Article I in the agreement states that `` purchases of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase and in accordance with normal commercial terms . '' 
`` The United States should supply to the Soviet Union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the United States ready to supply this ? '' 
he said . 
The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn , which he confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes , but said that if U.S. corn prices remain competitive , the Soviets will buy more if they need it . 
Wheat buying , however , is a different story , Melnikov said . 
`` If the United States is interested in selling its wheat , then they must offer competitive prices , and it 's up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered , '' he said . 
Last year 's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy , Melnikov said . 
He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer , U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels .

ITEL < ITEL > GETS FINANCING FOR ANIXTER BUY . 
Itel Corp said it obtained commitments from a syndicate of banks for a six-year secured loan of about 325 mln dlrs and had separately filed registration statements for two public offerings for a total of 150 mln dlrs to fund its December 1986 acquisition of < Anixter Bros Inc > .

Both offerings will be through Merrill Lynch Capital Markets . 
It said a portion of the proceeds from the offerings , together with the proceeds form the new bank loan , wll be used to repay the 395 mln dlr bridge loan Merrill Lynch and Co Inc < MER > provided for Itel to buy Anixter . 
Itel said the banks it obtained commitments from include Manufacturers Hanover Trust Co < MHC > , < Chemical Bank of New < York > , and the < First National Bank of Chicago > . 
GREAT AMERICAN < GTA > GAINS OVER 80 MLN IN LOANS . 
Great American First Savings Bank said the bank recorded gains exceeding 80 mln dlrs on sales of loans and mortgage securities valued at 1.1 billion dlrs . 
The San Diego-based bank said in a prepared release of its report to analysts here that the gains included 6.6 mln dlrs in arbitrage profits from the premium paid for the separation of interest and principal components of new Federal National Mortgage Association strip securities . 
The bank said it reported a profit of more than 20 mln dlrs on the transaction , involving 390 mln dlrs of FNMA securities , including the arbitrage gain . 
Great American recently announced plans to acquire < Capital Savings Bank > , Olympia , Wash. , and last year acquired < Home Federal Savings and Loan Association > , Tucson , Ariz. , and < Los Angeles Federal Savings Bank > , which resulted in 66 new offices and three billion dlrs in assets . 
The bank also said it plans to expand into other major western banking markets and is considering an acquisition in Colorado . 
SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION , OECD SAYS . 
Switzerland 's economy , combining low unemployment , financial stability and a large external payments surplus , is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future , the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development , OECD , said . 
This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government , it said . 
The OECD , in its annual report on Switzerland , picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year , but said these gave no cause for concern . 
The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year 's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985 . 
But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce , leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct , the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area . 
Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year , against 1.69 in the second half of 1986 , the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986 . 
The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last , reflecting buoyant private consumption , meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years . 
But `` given Switzerland 's large external surplus , there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP ... Which , if only in a small way , would contribute to improving international balances , '' the OECD said . 
Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year , with a 3.25 pct growth rate , after several years of relative weakness , it noted . 
In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate , but should still outstrip overall GDP , it added . 
The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987 , and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors , it said . 
As a consequence , growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986 . 
But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry , two major service sector earners of foreign exchange . 
The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc , and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets , could lead to a loss of international market share for both , it said . 
Particularly for the banks , `` recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system , which has shown substantial flexibility in the past , is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position , '' it said . 
TANDY BRANDS < TAB > SELLS UNIT . 
Tandy Brands Inc said it sold its Grate Home and Fireplace division to an investor group that includes some members of Grate 's management for 1,600,000 dlrs in cash and secured notes . 
The company said the sale will not materially offset the 9,848,000 dlr non-recurring charge it took against the sale of the division . 
AMERICAN FARM BUREAU OPPOSES FARM BILL CHANGES . 
The directors of the American Farm Bureau , the nation 's largest farm organization , voted Tuesday to urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without alterations . 
`` We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill , '' said Dean Kleckner , president . 
`` The current farm bill has been in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining the legislation . 
`` Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being advanced , '' Kleckner said . 
The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans competitive in the world market . 
A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and the new loan rate . 
The organization also urged Lyng to authorize deficiency payments to farmers who were unable to plant 1987 winter wheat because of adverse weather .

DEAN FOODS < DF > SEES STRONG 4TH QTR EARNINGS . 
Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same year-ago period , Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts . 
In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor reported earnings of 40 cts a share . 
Douglas also said the year 's sales should exceed 1.4 billion dlrs , up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year . 
He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter earnings `` will probably be off slightly '' from last year 's 40 cts a share , falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share . 
Douglas said it was too early to project whether the anticipated fourth quarter performance would be `` enough for us to exceed the prior year 's overall earnings '' of 1.53 dlrs a share . 
In 1988 , Douglas said Dean should experience `` a 20 pct improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform act alone . '' 
President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will derive benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co. . 
Dean also said the company will benefit from its acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc , West Chicago . 
He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I. Foods Ltd , a United Kingdom blender , and has licensing arrangements in Australia , Canada , Brazil and Japan . 
`` It provides ann entry to McDonalds Corp < MCD > we 've been after for years , '' Douglas told analysts . 
U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT . 
The U.S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program -LRB- EEP -RRB- , senior USDA officials said . 
However , grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made , though not in the very near future . 
`` The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again , '' an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said . 
`` But there just is n't much talk about it , informally or formally . '' 
Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets , even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week . 
But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow , it could take several months . 
`` I just do n't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process , '' the aide to Lyng said . 
`` An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight , '' said one former USDA official , who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program . 
An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress , a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets . 
But Lyng 's aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday , House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time . 
The administration 's interagency trade policy review group , comprised of subcabinet-level officials , has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP , officials at the U.S. Trade Representative 's Office said . 
In their talks this week , the two sides discussed the administration 's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative . 
One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of `` calm , basic , factual economics . '' 
Another USDA official said there was `` not even an informal suggestion or hint '' that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms . 
USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair .

VIACOM < VIA > MERGER EXPECTED IN 60 TO 90 DAYS . 
Sumner Redstone , president of National Amusements , Inc , predicted he can win regulatory approvals to wrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom International Inc in 60 to 90 days . 
Redstone , 63 , catapulted himself into the big leagues of entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and their financial backers decided not to top National 's bid . 
`` We 've had counsel working for some time in every region where Viacom has cable televison systems '' Redstone told Reuters in a telephone interview . 
Redstone also said `` Viacom is committed to working very closely with us to obtain approvals . '' 
Viacom has been seeking approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable systems since September when its management group first advanced a buyout plan . 
But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that Viacom 's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into a defintive merger agreement with National . 
National is a family business which operates a chain of movie theaters . 
It is dwarfed by Viacom . 
Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading electronic media company . 
He noted that the number of motion picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years . 
Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom , four are motion-picture oriented pay channels . 
Redstone said exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the emerging trend . 
`` Up until recently you could see any motion picture on any pay channel , '' Redstone said . 
He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month . 
Redstone said the management group 's investment bankers will be paid what is due for termination of its merger agreement . 
Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs . 
`` That will be a company expense , '' Redstone said . 
He said BankAmerica < BAC > Corp has had numerous inquiries from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr financing for the deal . 
BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs . 
After the merger , Viacom will be a subsidiary of National but 17 pct of the company will be in public hands . 
BRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM . 
A senior British official said that protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community -LRB- EEC -RRB- and threaten the global trading system . 
Paul Channon , secretary for trade and industry , said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports , which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers , `` the community would have to retaliate . '' 
His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo , who said if the bill passed , the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports . 
Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress . 
De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks . 
Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit , which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs . 
Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods . 
Channon said Japan 's trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations , 16.7 billion dlrs . 
`` The more united pressure there could be , the better , '' he said . 
Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes . 
He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards . 
`` But if both sides drew back from the brink that time , '' he said , '' `` it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion . '' 
Channon added that `` There is increasing reesentment in Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines . '' 
He said other potential conflicts are already in sight - alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils - and `` the commuity and the United States must therefore learn to manage their relations better . '' 
He said another bill to let the United States retaliate against a nation if that nation 's market was not open to U.S. goods would bypass the trade pact GATT -LRB- General Agreeeement on Tariffs and Trade -RRB- as an arbiter of trade practices . 
He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not by the United States , adding `` if the -LRB- trade -RRB- law is to be interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT , what is to happen to the rest of us ? '' 
YEUTTER SEEKS STRONGER TAIWAN , S.KOREA CURRENCIES . 
U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he hoped the U.S. dollar would continue to decline in relation to the currencies of Taiwan and South Korea as a way to improve the U.S. trade picture . 
Testifying before the House Appropriations subcommittee which must approve his agency 's 1988 budget , he said , `` In my judgment economic factors justify a continued decline . '' 
Asked by a committee member if he expected a further decline , and how much , Yeutter said the Taiwan and South Korean currencies should be adjusted to reflect `` positive factors '' in their economies .

China 's 1986 sugar crop has been revised to 5.26 mln tonnes -LRB- raw value -RRB- , down four pct from the previous forecast and five pct below the previous season , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . 
In its World Production and Trade Report , the department attributed the decline to relatively poor profitability of sugar , causing harvested area of cane and beets to decline seven pct from 1985 . 
Beet sugar production for 1986 is now estimated at 837,000 tonnes , five pct less than earlier forecast and down five pct from the previous season , while cane output is projected at 4.423 mln tonnes , down four pct from previously forecast and five pct below the previous season , it said .

TWA < TWA > TANGLES PIEDMONT < PIE > SITUATION . 
Trans World Airlines Inc complicated the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy Piedmont suitor USAir Group or , alternatively , to merge with Piedmont and USAir . 
Piedmont 's board was meeting today , and Wall Street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk Southern Corp and USAir . 
The TWA offer was announced shortly after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin . 
TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share . 
It also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price . 
TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont , but it said it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the airlines . 
Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena . 
`` We 're just wondering if he 's not just trying to get TWA into play . 
There 's speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else , '' said one arbitrager . 
`` We think TWA might just be putting up a trial balloon . '' 
Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir , but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals . 
They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements . 
`` They need to show their commitment and their ability to finance . 
I think it 's a credible offer , '' said Timothy Pettee , a Bear Stearns analyst . 
`` I think it 's certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals , '' said Pettee . 
Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers . 
USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer . 
A spokesman for USAir declined comment , and said USAir had not changed its offer for Piedmont . 
USAir offered of buy 50 pct of that airline 's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock . 
USAir closed up 5-3 at 49-1 on volume of 1.9 mln shares . 
Piedmont , which slipped 1 to close at 69-5 , also remained silent on the TWA action . 
Piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp. . 
Norfolk Southern declined comment , but said it stuck with its offer for Piedmont . 
Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of Piedmont . 
Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target . 
`` Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers . 
I think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive . 
One way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines , '' said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming . 
`` I do n't know whose going to buy them , but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package , '' said Kim . 
But Icahn 's financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt , in part because of TWA 's heavy debt load . 
Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do the offer . 
The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements . 
Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp < X > and still retains 11 pct of that company 's stock . 
Some Wall street sources said the financier 's USX plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser , Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc , because of Wall Street 's insider trading scandal . 
Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA offer on price and financing concerns . 
`` It 's littered with contingencies and it does n't even have a financing arrangement , '' said one executive at another major airline . 
But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a strong contender with USAir 's east coast route system and planned west coast presence from PSA . 
USAir could feed the intenrational flights of TWA , which has a midwest presence in its St. Louis hub . 
Adding Piedmont , dominant in the southeast , to the mix would develop an even stronger force . 
The combined entity would also have TWA 's pars reservation system . 
Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share .

Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China could be a member of GATT before the end of the year . 
`` They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member of the world economy , '' he told the House Appropriations subcommittee which oversees his agency 's budget . 
Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of China 's GATT membership , Yeutter said he could put the final touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip . 
The admission of China to GATT , which is the multinational group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade , would offer both potential export markets and potential competition for U.S. industries , he said . 
`` That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S. business , '' Yeutter said . 
`` I think China will develop into a fine market for us , '' he added . 
RIO COFFEE TRADE PREFERS NO PACT TO QUOTA CUT . 
The failure of talks to introduce new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee Agreement , ICA , was preferable to the alternative of Brazil having a sharply reduced quota , as had been proposed , President of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon said . 
He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil 's quota to 25 pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected . 
`` Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year , '' Calmon added . 
Calmon said , assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota , Brazil 's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln bags , of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln , leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export . 
`` It 's a pity the talks broke down , but for Brazil this was better than such a quota reduction , '' he added . 
In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green coffee , including about two mln bags to non-members . 
A severe drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under 10 mln bags . 
Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags , of which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export . 
The harvest this year should be around 30 mln bags , he added . 
The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last year 's harvest is 11.2 mln bags , although many traders believe it was higher than this .

Matters not on the agenda , however , can be brought before the council , the officials said . 
Grain trade officials have speculated that USDA would make a wheat export enhancement offer to Moscow , but USDA officials have said the matter is not under active consideration . 
USDA today transmitted to Congress a package of legislative proposals , including bills that would cut target prices and speed up loan rate reductions .

U.S. REAFFIRMS OPPOSITION TO EC OILS TAX PLAN . 
A meeting among government agencies today reaffirmed the strong opposition of the United States to a proposed new tax on vegetable oils and fats in the European Community , U.S. trade officials said . 
Representatives of the major government agencies agreed at a trade policy review group meeting , which includes officials of the deputy secretary rank , to continue diplomatic pressure on EC member states . 
`` We -LRB- all agencies -RRB- are together on this , '' said one U.S. trade official . 
One source said the U.S. would continue to make clear to member states and to the EC commission that if Brussels proceeds with the vegetable oils tax `` there will be a great cost . '' 
U.S. officials said no formal list of European products on which the U.S. might retaliate , has yet been drawn up . 
`` I do n't think we 're at that point yet , '' said one trade official , adding that the EC has only begun deliberations on its farm price package . 
Suzanne Early , assistant trade representative , told Reuters the interagency meeting was to discuss U.S. strategy on the vegetable oils issue . 
Asked about retaliation , she said `` sometimes its better not to be specific . '' 
U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter Monday warned another major transatlantic trade row will develop if the EC proceeds with the vegetable oils tax .

CANADA CENTRAL BANK HEAD SEES MODERATE GROWTH . 
Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said he expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming year , despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of 1986 . 
`` We see moderate growth , '' Crow told a news conference following presentation of the central bank 's annual report in the House of Commons today . 
He said there were positive signs of growth in the economy , particularly the drawdown of business inventories in the fourth quarter . 
Yesterday , Statistics Canada reported gross domestic product expanded a slight 0.2 pct in the quarter . 
Crow reiterated the bank 's previous statements that inflation remains a major priority in setting monetary policy and said only zero inflation would be acceptable . 
Canada 's inflation rate is currently hovering around the four pct mark . 
The governor said Canada 's banking system remains sound despite recent concern about exposure by the country 's banks in debt plagued countries such as Brazil . 
`` It -LRB- the debt problem -RRB- is not a happy development but I think it can be overplayed in terms of its impact , '' Crow told reporters .

ALLIS-CHALMERS < AH > PROPOSES RESTRUCTURING . 
Allis-Chalmers Corp said it asked lenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that would cause a dilution of the company 's existing common stock . 
The company said it would sell all of its businesses other than the American Air Filter business , make a public financing of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently outstanding debt with the proceeds . 
Under the plan , which was presented to institutional lenders , the company 's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp , `` substantial amounts '' of institutional debt would be converted to common stock of the restructured company . 
Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred stock for common . 
The exchange of the institutional debt and preferred stock for common equity will cause a `` resulting dilution of the existing common stock , '' Allis-Chalmers said in a statement . 
Under the plan , holders of existing common would hold about 15 pct of the restructured common stock . 
Holders of existing preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common . 
Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is bankruptcy . 
The restructuring must be approved by creditors , common and preferred holders , and present and former employees . 
Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing `` appears to represent the company 's only alternative if agreement upon the terms of the plan can not be reached . '' 
The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that would result from the restructuring . 
`` It is too early to talk about a charge '' because the plan must still be approved by the lenders and unions , he said . 
Also under the plan , payments to Allis-Chalmers ' private lenders would be deferred . 
Trade payables and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met . 
Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees would be made `` at substantially reduced levels . '' 
Allis-Chalmers , once one of the leading farm equipment companies , sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs , leaving the company with businesses in lift trucks , air conditioning , fluids handling and solid materials processing . 
Last year , Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to AC Material Handling Co of Columbus , Ohio . 
Under the restructuring plan , Allis-Chalmers will sell its solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses . 
Solid materials processing , which makes equipment to crush stones for highway construction , accounted for 288 mln dlrs of Allis-Chalmers 's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs . 
The company will also sell its fluids handling operations , which makes pumps and valves . 
That business accounted for 196 mln dlrs of the company 's 1985 revenues . 
Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs , or 1.09 dlrs a share . 
In 1985 , the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs , or 12.27 dlrs a share . 
The company 's last profit was in 1980 , when it earned 52.4 mln dlrs on sales of 2.1 billion dlrs .

YEUTTER CONCERNED ABOUT U.S. EXPORT PICTURE . 
U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he expects imports to fall soon but he was concerned about the lack of improvement in U.S. exports given the dollar 's decline in the last 18 months . 
`` I 'm convinced we 're about to see an improvement on the import side . 
I 'm more concerned about the export side , '' he told a House Appropriations subcommittee . 
Part of the blame goes on other countries which have not generated the economic growth to increase demand for U.S. goods and part to some U.S. companies which are not generating competitive exports , he said .

COFFEE PRICE DROP NOT AFFECTING COLOMBIA 'S DEBT . 
the sharp fall in international coffee prices will not affect colombia 's external credit situation , finance minister cesar gaviria told reuters . 
`` our foreign debt is high , but we can pay , and I hope the foreign banking community will maintain its position toward us , '' he said . 
He said the current decline on world coffee markets was not totally unexpected and would have no immediate bearing on colombia 's financial state , which he described as sound . 
Gaviria said the decline in coffee prices could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987 . 
The conservative party and the country 's largest trade union called this week for the debt to be rescheduled following the price drop . 
Colombia , the only major latin american country not to have rescheduled its external public debt , has a total foreign debt of 13.6 billion dlrs . 
USDA WOULD SCRAP COTTON , RICE , BEAN PRICE FLOORS . 
The package of proposed farm policy changes that the Reagan administration sent to Congress today includes a provision that would eliminate minimum price support levels for upland cotton , rice and soybeans . 
The package , obtained by Reuters , also includes a provision , outlined in advance by USDA officials , that would increase the annual permissible cut in the basic price support levels for all major crops to 10 pct from five pct . 
Under current law , the basic support prices for upland cotton , rice and soybeans between 1987 and 1990 can not be cut below 50 cents per lb , 6.50 dlrs per hundredweight and 4.50 dlrs per bushel , respectively . 
USDA 's intention to propose scrapping price floors for cotton , rice and soybeans had not been disclosed previously .

WTC said its board concluded in view of the social , political and economic situatin in South Africa , it was best to separate the company from its interests there . 
IVORY COAST SAYS COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT-LIVED . 
Ivory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation -LRB- ICO -RRB- meeting in London would not last long . 
Commenting on Monday 's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market , Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions . 
`` I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April , '' he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks . 
Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne , the lowest since 1982 . 
Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs -LRB- 1.76 billion dlrs -RRB- the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues . 
He disclosed that his country - the world 's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month . 
Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation -LRB- IACO -RRB- to speak on behalf of the continent 's 25 producer nations at the London talks . 
`` An initiative from IACO is likely very soon , '' he said without elaborating . 
`` Following the London collapse , we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market , '' he said . 
Questioned by journalists , the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season . 
Last year , the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs -LRB- 65 cents -RRB- per kilo . 
Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation . 
A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today 's weekly cabinet meeting , the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed `` his faith in Ivory Coast 's bright -LRB- economic -RRB- future '' despite the commodities price slide . 
The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs -LRB- 24.71 mln dlrs -RRB- to support the country 's small farmers . 
Financially-strapped Ivory Coast , long regarded as one of Africa 's showpiece economies , is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee . 
Ivory Coast 's real gross domestic product is expected to grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986 , according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate .

REAGAN 'S REMARKS HELP GOLD TO RECOVER IN HONG KONG . 
Gold rose by about 50 U.S. Cents an ounce , following a statement by President Ronald Reagan that the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran `` was a mistake , '' dealers said . 
Bullion rose to 409.40  90 dlrs from an initial low of 408.90  409.40 .

Dealers noted mild short-covering in the metal after some initial selling by local investors . 
Trading was fairly quiet this morning partly owed to the slow U.S. Dollar activities , they added . 
However , Reagan 's remarks had only a short-lived bullish impact on the gold price , which is now stabilising at 409.10  60 dlrs , dealers said . 
On the local market , the metal traded in a narrow range of 3,800 and 3,805 H.K. Dlrs a tael against yesterday 's 3,778 close . 
TAIWAN ISSUES MORE CDS TO CURB MONEY SUPPLY GROWTH . 
The central bank has issued 7.08 billion dlrs worth of certificates of deposit -LRB- CDs -RRB- , bringing the value of CD issues so far this year to 93.29 billion , a bank spokesman told Reuters . 
The new CDs , with maturities of six months , one year and two years , carry interest rates ranging from 3.9 to 5.15 pct . 
The issues are designed to help curb the growth of the M-1B money supply which has expanded along with Taiwan 's foreign exchange reserves , the spokesman said . 
The reserves reached a record high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs Wednesday . 
BONUS WHEAT FLOUR FOR NORTH YEMEN -- USDA .

The wheat four is for shipment March-May and the bonus awarded was 119.05 dlrs per tonnes and will be paid in the form of commodities from the CCC inventory . 
The bonus was awarded to the Pillsbury Company . 
The wheat flour purchases complete the Export Enhancement Program initiative announced in April , 1986 , it said . 
UNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER AFFECTS CHINA 'S AGRICULTURE . 
Abnormally warm and dry weather over most parts of China is seriously affecting crops , the New China News Agency said . 
It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in eight provinces , including Guangxi , Sichuan and Hunan . 
Plant diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing areas , it said . 
The agency said some areas of Guangxi , Hubei , Shanxi and other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than seven months . 
The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March , lowered the water level of many rivers , reduced hydroelectric power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and consumers . 
The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century , causing many ships to run aground and making harbour manoeuvres difficult , it said . 
The drought has also increased the number of forest fires . 
More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340 hectares of forest by mid-February , it said . 
TAIWAN SHIPBUILDER LOOKS FOR JAPANESE VENTURES . 
Taiwan 's state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp -LRB- CSBC -RRB- plans to seek joint production agreements with Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim its debts , chairman Louis Lo said . 
He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC 's first joint production venture , to build two hulls for < Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd > , was a success . 
Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms , including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd < MITH.T > and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd < JIMA.T > , he said . 
Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU -LRB- twenty foot equivalent unit -RRB- container ships this year to Onomichi , which would complete production . 
`` We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future , '' Lo said . 
He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing . 
This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea . 
Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975 . 
Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs , with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs . 
But he said the company , which is Taiwan 's largest shipbuilder , still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery . 
`` We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification , '' he said . 
Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the previous financial year . 
He estimated income would rise to more than 25 mln dlrs in 1986 . 
CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead weight tons -LRB- dwt -RRB- this financial year , compared with 11 ships of 462,000 dwt in 1985 , he said . 
Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least until 1991 due to overtonnage , but the outlook for ship repairing was bright . 
CREDITORS SEEK SWIFT RESCUE PACKAGE FOR JAPAN LINE . 
A group of creditor banks hopes to work out a rescue package for Japan Line Ltd < JLIT.T > , one of the world 's largest tanker operators , by the end of Japan 's business year on March 31 , a spokesman for the Industrial Bank of Japan Ltd < IBJT.T > -LRB- IBJ -RRB- said . 
Japan Line 's cumulative debt was 68.98 billion yen at the end of September , which exceeded shareholders ' equities and reserves totalling 63.40 billion . 
In December , Japan Line asked banks to shelve repayment of about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153 billion in loans to its subsidiaries . 
Japan Line said then that the yen 's steep rise and the world shipping recession had hit the company hard . 
The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said today that IBJ and three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in loans to Japan Line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy seven billion yen of new Japan Line shares . 
The spokesman for IBJ , Japan Line 's largest creditor , said the package may write off part of the outstanding loans and will be worked out before long . 
Commenting on the article , he said the details of the package have not yet been settled . 
AUSTRALIAN WHEAT EXPORTS RISE IN FEBRUARY . 
Australian wheat shipments rose to 1.33 mln tonnes in February from 1.01 mln in January , an Australian Wheat Board official said .

OPEC STICKING FIRM ON OFFICIAL PRICES - SUBROTO . 
OPEC countries are all sticking firmly to official crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is likely to continue into the third quarter , Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters . 
Subroto , attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference , blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand . 
`` If we stick to the production limitation , the third quarter will be in better balance . '' 
He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC 's December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through . 
Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council -LRB- GCC -RRB- had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices , Subroto said : `` Apparently they have taken care of that . '' 
`` They -LRB- the GCC -RRB- meet very often among themselves . 
I think they 'll help each other , '' he said . 
Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC 's Price Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date . 
`` Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting because ... Everyone is sticking to official prices , '' he said . 
TEXACO CANADA < TXC > LOWERS CRUDE POSTINGS . 
Texaco Canada said it lowered the contract price it will pay for crude oil 64 Canadian cts a barrel , effective today .

Texaco Canada last changed its crude oil postings on Feb 19 .

Pakistan 's foreign exchange reserves fell to 8.43 billion rupees in February from 8.96 billion in January , compared with 12.97 billion in February 1986 , the State Bank of Pakistan said . 
The bank gave no reason for the fall but local bankers said big import bills had affected the reserves . 
The Federal Bureau of Statistics has not yet released last month 's import and export figures . 
THAILAND REDUCES MAIN RICE CROP PROJECTION . 
Thailand 's main paddy crop is expected to fall to 15.4 mln tonnes in the 1986 -LRB- Nov -RRB- season from a previous 15.68 mln estimate in November and an actual 17.35 mln a year ago , the Thai Rice Mills Association said . 
It said a joint field survey late last month by the association , the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand indicated that paddy output in Thailand 's northeast region is lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces . 
The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon Ratchasima , Chaiyaphum , Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of 1986 . 
It said last November that the drought reduced total national areas sown with paddy to some 8.25 mln hectares this year , down from 8.84 mln a year ago . 
The main crop represents about 85 pct of Thailand 's paddy output . 
HOECHST GROUP PRE-TAX PROFIT FALLS IN 1986 .

BHP TO FLOAT GOLD UNIT WITH ONE-FOR-THREE ISSUE . 
The Broken Hill Pty Co Ltd < BRKN.S > -LRB- BHP -RRB- said it plans a renounceable one-for-three issue of rights to float a new company , < BHP Gold Mines Ltd > -LRB- BHPGM -RRB- , which will hold most of BHP 's gold interests . 
In a statement BHP said the 25-cent par rights would be priced at 50 cents for 430 mln of the BHPGM shares on offer . 
BHP will subscribe for the remaining 540 mln shares , or 56 pct of issued capital , on the same terms . 
BHPGM will pay 440 mln dlrs for BHP 's gold interests , excluding its stake in Papua New Guinea 's < Ok Tedi Mining Ltd > and those interests held by BHP 's < Utah International Inc > . 
The BHP statement said the issue will be made to shareholders registered on March 27 . 
It opens April 4 and closes April 29 , and is underwritten by < J.B. Were and Son > . 
Rights will be traded on Australian stock exchanges from March 23 to April 22 , and the new shares will be quoted from June 4 . 
BHP said the new company will be one of Australia 's larger gold producers , with annual output exceeding 170,000 ounces . 
It said there are plans to boost production to 300,000 ounces by the early 1990s . 
BHPGM 's portfolio will include several Australian mines -- 30 pct of Telfer , 100 pct of Ora Banda and Browns Creek and 20 pct of the new Boddington development . 
The statement said BHPGM would also hold BHP 's 45 pct stake in the Coronation Hill Property in the Northern Territory , and its 55 pct stake in a new venture near Gympie , Queensland . 
BHPGM chairman-designate John Gough said it was a quality gold stock . 
`` The diversity and depth of BHP Gold 's portfolio ... Give the company a sound foundation in current gold production and an exciting potential for growth , '' he said . 
HK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE . 
The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp < HKBH.HK > is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and 13 pct for 1986 , reflecting stronger than expected loan growth , share analysts polled by Reuters said . 
Their estimates of the bank 's net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs . 
Results will be announced on Tuesday . 
The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion . 
They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985 , adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue . 
Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year , probably one for three or one for five . 
The bank 's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd < HSGH.HK > is to report its 1986 results on Friday . 
Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time , an increase of 10 to 12 pct . 
They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985 . 
Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise , Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986 , when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct . 
`` They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand , as their loan portfolio is well balanced , '' an analyst at Mansion House Securities -LRB- F.E. -RRB- Ltd said . 
Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986 , compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985 . 
Loans to finance Hong Kong 's visible trade , the mainstay of the local economy , rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985 . 
Low interest rates also helped the bank . 
Interest received on loans was low , with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986 , but interest paid on savings was two pct . 
Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system , giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds . 
The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group . 
Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply . 
`` The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks , '' one analyst said . 
The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd < WAIA.HK > and < James Capel and Co > , analysts said . 
`` Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter , '' an analyst said . 
Wardley was underwriter for last year 's billion-dlr flotation of < Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd > , of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time . 
The bank 's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return for 1.57 billion dlrs . 
It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake in < South China Morning Post Ltd > , the larger of two English-language daily newspapers here , for 1.18 billion dlrs . 
The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will not show up in the profit and loss accounts , analysts said . 
Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced need to write off bad debts . 
`` The need for provisions was much lower than the year before , '' said Tony Measor of Hong Leong Securities Co Ltd. `` Last year 's profits should have been 2.8 to 2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions . '' 
Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its shipping exposure in 1985 . 
Lesley Nickolds of County Securities Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986 . 
She forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs . 
The bank 's Latin American exposure , mainly through its 51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc < MM > , appears to have improved substantially , analysts said . 
Marine Midland 's 1986 fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs from 89.2 mln a year before . 
Its 1986 net profit rose to 145 mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985 . 
HUGHES TOOL DIRECTORS REJECT MERGER WITH BAKER . 
The directors of Hughes Tool Co < HT > said they would recommend to shareholders that they reject a merger with Baker International Corp < BKO > today . 
Hughes vice-president Ike Kerridge said the recommendation would be put to shareholders at a meeting scheduled for 10 A.M. Local time -LRB- 1600 GMT -RRB- to discuss the proposed merger . 
Kerridge said the board met yesterday to discuss the merger but decided against it . 
The Hughes board objected to a U.S. Department of Justice requirement that Baker sell off several specialised subsidiaries in businesses related to oil-drilling . 
The Hughes board last week indicated that it might cancel the merger because of the Department of Justice requirement . 
The board of directors of the California-based Baker had approved the merger . 
On February 17 Baker said it had signed an agreement to sell one of the subsidiaries . 
The companies had been given until April 22 to comply with the Justice Department requirement , Kerridge said . 
CANON INC -LRB- CANN.T -RRB- YEAR ENDED DECMEBER 31 . 
Group shr 18.34 yen vs 58.72 Net 10.73 billion yen vs 37.06 billion Pretax 27.76 billion yen vs 84.78 billion Operating 30.06 billion yen vs 88.81 billion Sales 889.22 billion vs 955.78 billion Note - The company attributed the profit fall largely to the yen 's appreciation during the period . 
Domestic sales rose 0.4 pct to 274.17 billion yen from a year earlier while exports declined 9.9 pct to 615.04 billion . 
NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S , EUROPE , JAPAN . 
The highly visible drama involving the yen 's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies , thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions , Japanese and European research officials said . 
The officials , looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five -LRB- G-5 -RRB- industrial nations , told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture , which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances . 
Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan - European Community -LRB- EC -RRB- axis , to the discomfort of Europe . 
In many ways , not least in terms of rare international cooperation , the September , 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S. , Japan , West Germany , Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one . 
But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture , in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance , but not necessarily central significance , the officials said . 
The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place , the dollar was already on its way down . 
The agreement simply helped it on its way . 
Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely . 
`` You have to look at the dollar 's peak compared with now , and that was well before Plaza , '' he said . 
On February 25 , 1985 , the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen . 
On September 20 , the Friday before Plaza , it was 242 . 
Since then , despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action , the dollar trend has been down , down , down . 
Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen . 
The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story . 
The European currencies are moving back up against the yen . 
The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which , but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing . 
In 1986 , Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms , five pct in yen . 
This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus . 
Last January , Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S , against about a third in recent years . 
Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms , but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms . 
`` The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe , where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms , which is what is important to them . 
Suddenly , instead of the U.S. , It is Europe that is laying the golden egg , '' said de Hora . 
The EC is worried . 
EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales , but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base , compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade . 
The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms , a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance , and which will cause problems . 
`` This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries . 
But therefore , Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge , '' said Azusa Hayashi , Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry . 
`` If you want my objective view , I do n't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance . 
Last year , we asked for moderation in exports , and this year we may have to do so again , '' he said . 
THAI TIN EXPORTS RISE IN JANUARY . 
Thailand exported 1,816 tonnes of tin metal in January , up from 1,731 in December and 1,330 a year ago , the Mineral Resources Department said . 
It said major buyers last month were Singapore , Japan , Britain , the Netherlands , Malaysia and the U.S. 
USDA SAID UNLIKELY TO BROADEN CORN BONUS OFFER . 
The U.S. Agriculture Department probably will not offer a two dlr per bushel bonus payment to corn farmers for any erodible cropland they enrolled in the conservation reserve program last year , an aide to USDA Secretary Richard Lyng said . 
Sen. Charles Grassley -LRB- R-Iowa -RRB- said yesterday that Lyng had indicated he would consider giving those farmers the same two dlr bonus offered corn farmers who are signing up for the 1987 program this month . 
But the aide to Lyng said it was doubtful that the department would offer a retroactive bonus to farmers who enrolled land in the 10-year conservation reserve last year . 
`` How are you going to stop the tide , '' he said , referring to demands that would follow from other commodity groups . 
U.K. MONEY MARKET OFFERED EARLY ASSISTANCE . 
The Bank of England said it had invited an early round of bill offers from the discount houses . 
The Bank forecast the shortage in the system today at around 1.15 billion stg . 
Among the main factors affecting liquidity , bills maturing in official hands and the take-up of treasury bills will drain some 732 mln stg and exchequer transactions some 245 mln . 
In addition , bankers ' balances below target and a rise in note circulation will drain a further 135 mln stg and 30 mln stg respectively . 
BELGOLUX TRADE MOVES INTO SURPLUS IN 1986 . 
The Belgo-Luxembourg Economic Union -LRB- BLEU -RRB- moved into a narrow trade surplus of 4.7 billion francs in 1986 after a 140.4 billion franc deficit in 1985 , figures given by a spokesman for the National Statistics Institute show . 
He said imports fell last year to 3,061.8 billion francs from 3,304.1 in 1985 while exports were also lower at 3,066.6 billion francs against 3,163.7 billion . 
In December , the BLEU had an 11.9 billion franc trade surplus after a 10.9 billion franc surplus in November and a 2.3 billion franc surplus in December 1985 . 
SPAIN RAISES BANKS ' RESERVE REQUIREMENT . 
The Bank of Spain said it raised the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened money supply and inflation targets . 
In a statement issued late last night , the central bank said the measure would take effect from March 13 . 
`` In recent weeks , there has been excess liquidity in the Spanish economy which , if not controlled , would threaten the monetary and inflation targets set by the government , '' the statement said . 
Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200 billion pesetas from the system . 
The maximum reserve requirement allowed by law is 20 pct . 
The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the Bank of Spain 's key overnight call money rate , which now stands at 13.5 pct . 
At today 's auction , however , the bank left the rate unchanged . 
Spain 's principal measure of money supply , the broad-based liquid assets in public hands -LRB- ALP -RRB- , grew at annualised rate of 8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of 1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987 . 
Banking sources said that although the January money supply figures were good , compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986 , ALP growth appeared to have accelerated in February , raising government concern . 
Regarding inflation , recent figures have suggested that prices were under control . 
Secretary of State for Trade , Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez , said this week that the annualised inflation rate for February , not yet officially announced , fell to 5.5 pct from six pct in January , compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during 1986 and a government target of five pct for this year . 
INDIA AND JAPAN TO DISCUSS IRON ORE PRICES . 
The state-owned Minerals and Metals Trading Corp will send a team to Japan next week to negotiate an iron ore export contract for 1987 beginning April 1 , trade sources said . 
Japan , the biggest buyer of Indian iron ore with imports of around 23 mln tonnes a year , has asked India to reduce prices from the current average of 18 dlrs a tonne , the sources said . 
`` Japan has said it may be forced to reduce ore imports from India next year if New Delhi fails to reduce the price , '' one source said , but declined to give further details . 
MARATHON PETROLEUM REDUCES CRUDE POSTINGS . 
Marathon Petroleum Co said it reduced the contract price it will pay for all grades of crude oil one dlr a barrel , effective today . 
The decrease brings Marathon 's posted price for both West Texas Intermediate and West Texas Sour to 16.50 dlrs a bbl . 
The South Louisiana Sweet grade of crude was reduced to 16.85 dlrs a bbl . 
The company last changed its crude postings on Jan 12 . 
TAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT NEW HIGH . 
Taiwan 's foreign exchange reserves hit a new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4 , compared with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year earlier , the central bank said . 
Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase came mainly from the bank 's purchases of more than one billion U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and March 4 . 
He said the rise showed signs of slowing , however , because Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade surplus to decline over the next few months as a result . 
Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise , but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987 . 
In January , Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct on some 1,700 foreign products . 
It had been under growing U.S. Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the U.S. Taiwan 's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2 billion , according to official statistics . 
Wang Chang-Ming , Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development , told Reuters the government is planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half of this year . 
The reserves could support imports of more than two years for Taiwan , compared with about three months for Japan and the U.S. 
BELGIAN ECU COIN ISSUE PRICED , SALE DATE SET . 
A limited Belgian issue of silver Ecu coins with a face value of five Ecus will go on sale from March 23 at a price of 500 Belgian francs each , a Finance Ministry spokesman said . 
Gold Ecu coins with a face value of 50 Ecus will be sold from the same day . 
The spokesman told Reuters the price for these would be fixed just before they go on sale but was likely to be between 8,500 and 9,000 francs . 
At least two mln silver coins and several hundreds of thousands of the gold coins will be minted , he said . 
They will be sold both in Belgium and abroad . 
The coins will be the first ever denominated in the Ecu , the `` basket '' comprised of the 12-nation European Community 's currencies except the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo . 
The issue is being made to mark the 30th anniversary of the EC 's founding Treaty of Rome this month . 
Finance Minister Mark Eyskens , who currently presides over the EC 's council of economic and finance ministers , has called the issue a political act of symbolic value which aimed to make the Community 's goal of monetary integration more concrete . 
The coins will be legal tender in Belgium but most demand is expected to come from coin collectors . 
U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN 17 MLN STG EARLY HELP . 
The Bank of England said it provided just 17 mln stg assistance to the money market in response to an early round of bill offers . 
Earlier , the Bank had estimated the shortage in the system today at around 1.15 billion stg . 
The central bank purchased bills for resale to the market on April 2 at an interest rate of 10-15 pct . 
FIRS SLIGHTLY RAISES EC BEET SUGAR OUTPUT ESTIMATE . 
The French sugar market intervention board , FIRS , raised its estimate of 1986 beet sugar production in the 12-member European Community to 13.76 mln tonnes white equivalent in its end-February report from 13.74 mln a month earlier . 
Its forecast for total EC sugar production , including cane and molasses , rose to 14.10 mln tonnes from 14.09 mln . 
Portugal , which joined the Community in January 1986 , was estimated at 12.75 mln tonnes white equivalent , unchanged from the previous forecast and compared with 12.41 mln tonnes for 1985 . 
Production for the current campaign in Spain was higher than reported last month at 1.03 mln tonnes compared with 997,000 tonnes . 
Beet sugar production , expressed as white equivalent , was estimated at 3.44 mln tonnes in France , 3.17 mln tonnes in West Germany , 1.72 mln in Italy , 1.30 mln in Britain , 1.22 mln in the Netherlands , 936,000 tonnes in Belgium , 499,000 in Denmark , 287,000 in Greece , 183,000 in Ireland and 4,000 in Portugal . 
PAPUA NEW GUINEA PLANS RESOURCES INVESTMENT AGENCY . 
The Papua New Guinea Government will establish a public corporation to invest in resources projects , Minerals and Energy Minister John Kaputin said . 
`` We intend to provide a means through which less privileged individuals can become part owners and beneficiaries from the development of mining and petroleum projects , '' he told Parliament . 
Existing policy allowing the state up to 30 pct equity in major mining projects and 22.5 pct in oil and gas projects would be maintained , he said . 
The planned agency could take over the state 's equity in current developments . 
Kaputin said Papua New Guinea was experiencing a boom with exploration companies spending about 60 mln kina annually on about 150 mining and 23 petroleum projects . 
`` The Government is determined to ensure that Papua New Guinean ownership in minerals and petroleum projects increases in an orderly way , '' he said . 
Kaputin did not say when the corporation would be established or exactly what form it would take , but said the government would study whether it should be directly involved in exploration or development . 
NIGERIAN CURRENCY FIRMS AT LATEST AUCTION . 
The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct against the dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding at today 's weekly foreign exchange auction , the central bank said . 
The naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar , against 3.9050 last week . 
Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold , with all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency . 
The effective rate , including a central bank levy , for transactions in the coming week , was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last week . 
The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the central bank 's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as punishment for inadequate documentation in previous transactions . 
Banks are required to submit proof that their bids are based on valid commercial transactions and the central bank has complained in the past that many are failing to produce the right paperwork within the specified time . 
U.S. TELLS JAPAN TO DO MORE TO CUT TRADE SURPLUS . 
U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to reduce its large trade surplus with the United States . 
`` Our central message to Japan this week was that while we have made progress in some areas , much needs to be done , '' he told a press conference after three days of talks . 
`` What we need is a resolution of trade issues , we need visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more imports and we need greater domestic-led growth . '' 
Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year , Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce its trade surplus , which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986 . 
He named several areas of particular concern to Washington -- computer microchips , supercomputers , Kansai airport , agricultural products and car telephones . 
He warned that the U.S.  Japan agreement governing trade in semiconductors was in jeopardy . 
Despite the pact , Japanese producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other than the United States while U.S. Penetration of the Japanese market has not increased , he said . 
TAIWAN BUYS 60,000 TONNES OF U.S. MAIZE . 
The joint committee of Taiwan 's maize importers has awarded contracts to two U.S. Companies to supply two shipments of maize , totalling 60,000 tonnes , a committee spokesman told Reuters . 
Continental Grain Co of New York received the first 30,000 tonne cargo contract , priced at 93.86 U.S. Dlrs per tonne , while Peavey Co of Minneapolis won the second shipment , also 30,000 tonnes , at 93.36 dlrs per tonne . 
Both shipments are c and f Taiwan and are set before March 16 , the spokesman said . 
GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT . 
The outlook for the West German economy is relatively bright , with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year , Kiel University 's Institute for World Economy said . 
The GNP forecast by the institute , one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany , is more optimistic than that of the other institutes , some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct . 
In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany 's export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark 's strength against the dollar and other major currencies . 
`` The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears , all in all , limited , '' the report said . 
`` On the contrary , a slight rise in exports can be expected . '' 
The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs , trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges . 
They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries . 
At the same time , the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year . 
West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending , both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy , the institute said . 
However , it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours . 
The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation . 
It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession . 
It said central banks in industrialized countries , including the Bundesbank , had followed the Federal Reserve Board 's expansionary course . 
The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S. Policy towards a more restrictive policy . 
Other central banks were likely to follow suit , causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world . 
Although Germany can not entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy , it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home . 
The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest . 
Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned , and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986 . 
It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct .

CREDITOR BANKS MAY BUY INTO SINGAPORE COFFEE FIRM . 
The nine creditor banks of the Singapore coffee trader < Teck Hock and Co -LRB- Pte -RRB- Ltd > are thinking of buying a controlling stake in the company themselves , a creditor bank official said . 
Since last December the banks have been allowing the company to postpone loan repayments while they try to find an overseas commodity company to make an offer for the firm . 
At least one company has expressed interest and negotiations are not yet over , banking sources said . 
However , the banks are now prepared to consider taking the stake if they find an investor willing to inject six to seven mln dlrs in the company but not take control , the banking sources said . 
Teck Hock 's financial adviser , Singapore International Merchant Bankers Ltd -LRB- SIMBL -RRB- , will work on the new proposal with the creditor banks , they said . 
Major holdings are likely to be held by the two largest creditor banks , Standard Chartered Bank < STCH.L > and Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd < OCBM.SI > , they added . 
Teck Hock owes over 100 mln Singapore dlrs and the creditor banks earlier this week agreed to let Teck Hock fufill profitable contracts to help balance earlier losses . 
The nine banks are Oversea-Chinese Banking Corp Ltd , United Overseas Bank Ltd < UOBM.SI > , < Banque Paribas > , < Bangkok Bank Ltd , > < Citibank NA > , Standard Chartered Bank Ltd , Algemene Bank Nederland NV < ABNN.AS > , Banque Nationale De Paris < BNPP.PA > and < Chase Manhattan Bank NA .

ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS . 
Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago . 
Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure , saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses . 
Some of them are `` too sophisticated to convert into financial terms , '' one banking source said . 
But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate . 
They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland 's economy , and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory . 
`` Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under - achieving . 
They did have a bad effect , yes , but they only contributed to largely internal , economic problems , '' one said . 
The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation -LRB- MFN -RRB- trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law . 
The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy , an offshoot of the central planning commission . 
According to one Western envoy , an expert on Polish economic affairs , it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States , as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders . 
But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely , he said , dismissing the estimate as `` a theoretical projection based on a high point , which has no real scientific evaluation . '' 
A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. . 
In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed . 
Imports have suffered , slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln , as credits ran out . 
Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West . 
Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion , official figures show . 
Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment , textiles , chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons . 
`` Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons , '' said one expert . 
`` It 's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy . '' 
`` There 's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it , '' another said , adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today 's reality . 
Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as `` nebulous , '' one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges . 
Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland , which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry . 
`` MFN does n't really mean anything , only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries . 
It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now , '' said one Western envoy . 
He said Polish products were not competitive , and their quality was too low . 
Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S. , Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland 's efforts to regain entry . 
Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently . 
Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently , `` Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult , and in certain cases impossible ... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs . '' 
While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation , it says it has a `` moral right '' to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally . 
But a Western economist said `` The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy wo n't cut any ice . 
The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity . '' 
Nevertheless , Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka , in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund -LRB- IMF -RRB- and World Bank , made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States . 
He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States , `` but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners . '' 
He stressed that the U.S. `` had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland 's partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt . '' 
Putting it more sharply , one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank , IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role . 
`` As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations , '' he said , citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate . 
U.K. FOURTH QUARTER TRADE DEFICIT 2.6 BILLION STG . 
Britain had a visible trade deficit of 2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter , official statistics show . 
Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central Statistical Office -LRB- CSO -RRB- show the current account was in deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third quarter shortfall of 930 mln . 
For 1986 as a whole , visible trade was in deficit by 8.3 billion stg , sharply up from 1985 's 2.2 . 
Billion shortfall and a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984 . 
Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion . 
The fourth quarter figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday . 
The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to 1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion . 
In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg . 
The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln , the CSO said . 
However , 1986 's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg lower than in 1985 , while the deficit on non-oil trade increased by 2.1 billion . 
The figures were broadly in line with market expectations . 
The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions , particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to substantial revisions as later information becomes available . 
BELGIAN WHOLESALE PRICES FALL IN JANUARY . 
Belgian wholesale prices fell by 5.9 pct in January from a year earlier after a 5.7 pct year on year fall in December , figures from the economics ministry show . 
A ministry spokesman said the wholesale price index , base 1953 and excluding value added tax , stood at 250.9 in January . 
This compared with 251.9 in December , 265.5 in Janua ~ y , 1986 and 267.2 in December , 1985 . 
In January 1986 , wholesale prices were 3.9 pct lower than a year earlier . 
CARGILL U.K. STRIKE TALKS POSTPONED TILL MONDAY . 
Talks set for today between management and unions to try to solve the labour dispute at Cargill U.K. Ltd 's Seaforth oilseed crushing plant have been rescheduled for Monday , a company spokesman said . 
Oilseed processing at the mill has been at a standstill since December 19 . 
FRENCH INTERVENTION RATE CUT LIKELY , DEALERS SAY . 
The Bank of France is likely to cut its money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the start of next week . 
This follows a steady decline in the call money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall , dealers said . 
The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five industrial countries and Canada on February 22 , which restored considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks of turbulence . 
The call money rate dropped to around 8-3 pct on February 23 , the day after the Paris accord , and then edged steadily down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3 pct on March 3 , where it has now stabilised . 
Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3 pct . 
While call money has dropped by well over a percentage point , the Bank of France 's money market intervention rate has remained unchanged since January 2 , when it was raised to eight pct from 7-1 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide . 
The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at 8-3 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5 . 
The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates , while using the intervention rate to set the floor . 
Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut , and dealers said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday , although an earlier cut could not be excluded . 
A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early as tomorrow morning , banking sources said . 
They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an acceleration in foreign funds returning to France , discouraging the authorities from making a hasty rate cut . 
But they also pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target , giving scope for a small fall in rates . 
M-3 money supply , the government 's key aggregate , finished 1986 within the government 's three to five pct growth target , rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985 . 
RELIEF TO U.S. CORN GROWERS SAID LIKELY . 
U.S. farmers who in the past have grown oats for their own use but failed to certify to the government that they had done so probably will be allowed to continue planting that crop and be eligible for corn program benefits , an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said . 
Currently a farmer , to be eligible for corn program benefits , must restrict his plantings of other program crops to the acreage base for that crop . 
Several members of Congress from Iowa have complained that farmers who inadvertantly failed to certify that they had grown oats for their own use in the past now are being asked to halt oats production or lose corn program benefits . 
USDA likely will allow historic oats farmers to plant oats but not extend the exemption to all farmers , Lyng 's aide said . 
U.K. GRAIN FUTURES VOLUME DOWN IN FEBRUARY . 
Traded volumes for U.K. Grain and potato futures in February were down on the previous month while pigmeat and pig cash settlement futures were higher , official figures show . 
Combined wheat and barley futures trade declined to 892,700 tonnes from 1.19 mln in January , and the value fell to 97 mln stg from 129 mln , Grain and Feed Trade Association -LRB- GAFTA -RRB- figures show . 
A total of 984,960 tonnes were registered for main crop potato futures in February valued at 157 mln stg , versus 992,760 and 164 mln stg in January . 
Soymeal futures trade totalled 76,340 tonnes against 90,680 in January , and value declined to nine mln stg from 10 mln . 
Nine pigmeat contracts were traded in February , six more than in the previous month , representing 450 carcases against 150 , valued at 29,347 stg against 9,847 stg . 
Pig cash settlement futures saw 201 contracts traded , against 19 in January , and the value rose to 659,864 stg from 119,610 stg . 
BUNDESBANK LEAVES CREDIT POLICIES UNCHANGED . 
The Bundesbank left credit policies unchanged after today 's regular meeting of its council , a spokesman said in answer to enquiries . 
The West German discount rate remains at 3.0 pct , and the Lombard emergency financing rate at 5.0 pct . 
TURKEY TO IMPORT 100,000 TONNES OF CRYSTAL SUGAR . 
Turkey has announced a tender to import 100,000 tonnes of white crystal sugar with an advertisement in local newspapers . 
Turkish Sugar Factories said in the advertisement there was a 50 pct option to increase or decrease the amount and bids should reach it before March 24 . 
The semi-official Anatolian Agency recently quoted Turkish Minister of Industry and Trade Cahit Aral as saying Turkey will export 100,000 tonnes of sugar this year and import the same amount . 
U.K. MONEY MARKET GIVEN FURTHER SMALL ASSISTANCE . 
The Bank of England said it provided the money market with a further 20 mln stg of assistance during the morning . 
It again bought bills for resale to the market on April 2 at a rate of 10-15 pct . 
Earlier this morning , it bought 17 mln stg of bills at the same rate and for resale on the same date . 
The Bank has thus given a total of 37 mln stg so far today , which leaves the bulk of a 1.15 billion stg shortage still in the system . 
Dealers noted that money market rates again eased this morning and the Bank may have refused bill offers from the discount houses at rates below its established dealing levels . 
N.Z. MONEY SUPPLY RISES 3.6 PCT IN DECEMBER . 
New Zealand 's broadly defined , seasonally adjusted M-3 money supply grew an estimated 3.6 pct in December after rising a revised 2.4 pct in November and 4.04 pct in December last year , the Reserve Bank said in a statement . 
It said unadjusted M-3 increased to an estimated 30.07 billion N.Z. Dlrs from a revised 28.30 billion in November and 25.53 billion in December 1985 . 
Year-on-year M-3 rose 17.77 pct from a revised 15.34 pct in November and 20.50 pct in December 1985 . 
Narrowly defined year-on-year M-1 growth was 15.89 pct against a revised 27.52 pct in November and 12.3 pct a year earlier . 
M-1 grew to an estimated 5.03 billion dlrs against a revised 4.77 billion in November and 4.34 billion in December 1985 . 
Year-on-year private sector credit grew 30.68 pct in December against a revised 22.30 pct in November and 23.2 pct in December 1985 . 
Private sector credit grew to 22.24 billion dlrs from a revised 20.92 billion in November and 17.01 billion in December 1985 .

CIRCUIT SYSTEMS < CSYI > BUYS BOARD MAKER . 
Circuit Systems Inc said it has bought all of the stock of -LRB- Ionic Industries Inc -RRB- in exchange for 3,677,272 shares of its common . 
Following the exchange there will be 4,969,643 shares of Circuit Systems stock outstanding . 
Ionic holders will own about 74 pct of the outstanding stock of Circuit Systems , it said . 
Ionic , a maker of circuit boards , had revenues of 8.4 mln dlrs and pretax profits of 232,000 dlrs in 1986 , up from revenues of 5.9 mln and pretax profits of 204,000 dlrs in 1985 , Circuit Systems said . 
EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING . 
OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd , down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December , a Reuter survey shows . 
The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders , industry executives and analysts in Europe , the Middle East , Africa , Latin America and Asia . 
They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system , which came into effect last month . 
OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling , largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait , the figures show . 
The UAE , together with the much smaller producer Ecuador , was also producing above quota in the first days of March , the survey reveals . 
But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output , together with Iran `` s inability to export as much as its quota allows . 
Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March , the figures showed . 
Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February , against a 4.133 mln bpd quota . 
The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production . 
Kuwait , which has consistently denied quota violations , was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota . 
Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria , both substantially under quota in February and early March . 
Qatar 's February output was 230,000 bpd , and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota . 
Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar `` s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers . 
Nigeria 's early March output was about one mln bpd , down from 1.14 mln bpd in February and its quota of 1.238 mln bpd . 
Industry sources say Nigeria 's customers believe its Bonny grades are overpriced compared with compatible Brent crudes from the U.K. North Sea .

BAKER < BKO > SUES TO FORCE HUGHES < HT > MERGER . 
Baker International corp said it has filed suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Co to complete its proposed merger with Baker . 
Late yesterday , Hughes said it had terminated the merger agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative divestiture plan devised by Hughes . 
Hughes ' board had previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent decree that would have required broader divestitures . 
Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice Department consent decree . 
Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the counting of votes on the deal . 
Baker said it believes the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger . 
Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the merger , as an alternative to the consent decree , were `` more burdensome '' than those of the consent decree themselves . 
Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs or three pct . 
Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of the units named in the consent decree . 
It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to live up to the merger agreement or `` substantial '' monetary damages it did not name . 
Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best interests of shareholders of both companies . 
SPAIN DEREGULATES BANK DEPOSIT INTEREST RATES . 
Spain 's Finance Ministry deregulated bank deposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks and bring legislation into line with the European Community -LRB- EC -RRB- , a ministry spokesman said . 
The measure was published today in the Official State Gazette . 
It takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on rates , now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days . 
The government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct from 13 pct the proportion of total assets which banks must lend at favourable rates to industries classified `` of public interest . '' 
Some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in a 20 pct drop in profits this year . 
Secretary of State for the Economy Guillermo de la Dehesa told Reuters in a recent interview the reduction in fixed asset investments would offset losses from the rate liberalisation . 
USAIR < U > REJECTS TWA < TWA > TAKEOVER BID . 
USAir Group Inc said its board has rejected Trans World Airlines Inc 's offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the best interests of USAir shareholders , employees or passengers . 
The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C. Icahn-led TWA was `` highly conditional . '' 
USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc < PIE > met separately yesterday to consider USAir 's offer to acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each , valued at about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of USAir common during a period just before the merger . 
The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies hope to reach one very shortly . 
USAir said `` In light of the highly conditional nature and other terms of the TWA offer , the timing of the offer and the circumstances under which it was made , USAir Group believes that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir Group 's proposed acquisition of Piedmont . 
`` TWA 's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group 's acquisition of Piedmont , a transaction which the USAir Group board views as most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders , employees and passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to his own personal interests . '' 
USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA 's last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group 's acquisition of Piedmont . 
The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA obtaining financing , the USAir board redeeming defensive rights issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the `` fair price '' provision contained in USAir 's charter inapplicable to the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval .

FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT . 
The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks , accelerating in recent days , has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil . 
The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels , down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year . 
Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher , prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number . 
However , much of that export demand seems to have been met , with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months . 
U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter , so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest , soyproduct dealers said . 
Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks , setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today . 
`` Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May , looking for no deliveries -LRB- on first notice day tomorrow , which would cause March to gain on deferreds -RRB- , '' one CBT crush trader said . 
`` But they 've been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered , if not tomorrow , then later in the month , '' he added . 
As a result of the weakness in soymeal , the March crush ratio -LRB- The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans -RRB- fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today , dropping over five cents in just the last two days . 
The May crush ended today just over 17 cents , so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level , the trader said . 
Hopefully , they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand , he added . 
With futures down , processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans , further reducing crush margins . 
A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices , down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production , cash dealers said . 
Most soybean processing plants are still in operation , with little talk of taking temporary down-time , so far . 
But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins , they added . 
U.S. FIRST TIME JOBLESS CLAIMS FALL IN WEEK . 
New applications for unemployment insurance benefits fell to a seasonally adjusted 332,900 in the week ended Feb 21 from 368,400 in the prior week , the Labor Department said . 
The number of people actually receiving benefits under regular state programs totaled 3,014,400 in the week ended Feb 14 , the latest period for which that figure was available . 
That was up from 2,997,800 the previous week . 
JAGUAR SEES STRONG GROWTH IN NEW MODEL SALES . 
Jaguar Plc < JAGR.L > is about to sell its new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a strong reception based on its success in the U.K. , Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference . 
Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg , slightly below 1985 's 121.3 mln , Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year . 
However , the introduction of the new model had kept this year 's pre-tax profit down . 
Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. . 
In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987 . 
U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover , finance director John Edwards said . 
A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet , but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an `` umbrella '' for Jaguar . 
He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car 's price . 
Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods , John Egan said . 
In the longer term , capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales . 
Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct . 
Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half . 
The firm is in early stages of considering the building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg , but Egan said this would take at least another three years On the London Stock Exchange , Jaguar 's shares were last quoted at 591p , down from 611p at yesterday 's close , after reporting 1986 results which were in line with market expectations , dealers said .

Chrysler Corp and Regie Natiionale des Usines Renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks the period for reaching definitive agreement on Chrysler 's proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp. . 
The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on March nine set April nine as the target date for completing negotiations . 
However , the letter also allowed room for an extension of that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached . 
The two companies said they `` now plan to complete work by April 23 . '' 
Chrysler and Renault said , `` Given the complex nature of the deal , the need for additional time was to be expected . '' 
The March letter of intent between the two companies says that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date `` in the event that prior to April 9 , 1987 , Chrysler discovers an unforeseen problem in the course of its ` due diligence ' investigation of the company , '' referring to American Motors . 
A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem had cropped up in the talks . 
She stuck by the company 's statement that more time was needed because the talks are complex . 
`` That is our definition of the delay , '' she said . 
Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault , their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or when an agreement was reached . 
But the letter could be amendend by a written agreement by both companies . 
The Chrysler spokeswoman said , `` We are still working toward a definitive agreement . '' 
Said another Chrysler official who is not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in trouble : `` There are no glitches . '' 
Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay .

It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was much higher than a year ago , caused by a increase in shipments than the 1986 quarter , which was impacted by a strike . 
Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year 's first quarter from a year ago , mainly because of the inclusion of RCA 's aerospace and defense business , the company said . 
In addition , consumer products revenues were up from last year , mainly because of including sales of RCA video products . 
General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987 .

SOUTH KOREA CORN IMPORTS MAY INCREASE - USDA . 
South Korea 's purchase of about 2.4 mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to double last year 's total -- indicates that imports from the United States , as well as total imports are set for a dramatic jump , the U.S. Agriculture Department said . 
In its World Production and Trade Report , the department said total South Korea corn imports for the 1986 season -LRB- Oct-Sept -RRB- are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes , with about 3.4 mln tonnes from the United States . 
During the 1985 season , imports totaled only 1.3 mln tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes .
